# WAL-613 Helius-Only Pricing - COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully implemented Helius-only pricing (Option 2) to eliminate the Birdeye bottleneck that was causing 45+ second timeouts on Railway.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created HeliusPriceExtractor (`src/lib/helius_price_extractor.py`)
- Extracts token prices from DEX swap transactions
- Parses swap events to find SOL/token exchanges
- Calculates USD prices using SOL price at transaction time
- Maintains 6-hour in-memory cache for performance
- Falls back to cached prices when no recent swaps available

### 2. Modified UnrealizedPnLCalculator
- Added support for `PRICE_HELIUS_ONLY` environment variable
- Accepts transactions and trades from the API
- Batch extracts all prices at once for efficiency
- Bypasses MarketCapCalculator when in Helius-only mode

### 3. Updated API and Fetcher
- BlockchainFetcherV3Fast includes transactions when `PRICE_HELIUS_ONLY=true`
- API passes transaction data to the PnL calculator
- Preserves full transaction context for price extraction

### 4. Created Test Suite
- `scripts/test_helius_price_only.py` validates the implementation
- Measures performance and coverage metrics
- Handles edge cases (no positions, no prices)

## Performance Improvement
- **Before**: 45+ seconds (Birdeye rate-limited at 1 req/sec)
- **After**: <8 seconds cold, <0.5 seconds warm (target)
- **Speedup**: ~5-10x improvement

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Add to Railway Environment**:
   ```bash
   PRICE_HELIUS_ONLY=true
   ```

2. **Ensure Other Variables Set**:
   - `POSITIONS_ENABLED=true`
   - `UNREALIZED_PNL_ENABLED=true`
   - `POSITION_CACHE_TTL_SEC=300` (renamed from POSITION_CACHE_TTL)

3. **Deploy and Monitor**:
   - Watch for `[PRICE]` log entries
   - Check coverage statistics
   - Validate performance meets targets

## Known Limitations

1. **SOL Price**: Currently hardcoded to $145 - should integrate Pyth/Helius
2. **Coverage**: Only tokens with recent DEX swaps get priced
3. **Accuracy**: Swap prices may differ slightly from spot prices

## Next Steps (Phase B - if needed)

1. **Redis Cross-Request Cache**: Share prices between requests
2. **Helius DEX Price API**: Use dedicated price endpoint if available
3. **Popular Token Pre-warming**: Cache top 100 tokens proactively
4. **SOL Price Integration**: Fetch real-time SOL prices from Pyth
