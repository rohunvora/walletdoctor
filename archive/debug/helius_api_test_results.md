# Helius API Test Results Report

## Executive Summary

The debug tests reveal **critical data gaps** in the Helius API that explain why your trading history is incomplete:

### Key Findings:

1. **Massive Transaction Count Mismatch**
   - Wallet 1: Only **35 SWAP transactions** found (vs **814 tokens traded** shown in screenshot)
   - Wallet 2: Only **33 SWAP transactions** found (vs **140 tokens traded** shown in screenshot)

2. **Missing Swap Events**: 
   - Wallet 1: **80%** of SWAP transactions lack swap event data (28/35)
   - Wallet 2: **76%** of SWAP transactions lack swap event data (25/33)

3. **Limited Token Discovery**:
   - Wallet 1: Only **1 unique token** found (vs 814 expected)
   - Wallet 2: Only **2 unique tokens** found (vs 140 expected)

4. **DEX Coverage Issues**:
   - Only RAYDIUM swaps have proper event data
   - PUMP_AMM transactions are marked as SWAP but have no swap events
   - Many DEXs appear to be missing entirely

## Detailed Results

### Wallet 1: 3JoVBiQEA2QKsq7TzW5ez5jVRtbbYgTNijoZzp5qgkr2

**Transaction Analysis:**
```
Total SWAP transactions: 35
Has swap event: 7 (20%)
Missing swap event: 28 (80%)
Multi-hop swaps: 0
Sources: RAYDIUM only
```

**Recent Activity Sample (100 transactions):**
- 11 SWAP transactions
- 89 TRANSFER transactions
- Sources: SYSTEM_PROGRAM (85), PUMP_AMM (7), RAYDIUM (4), etc.

**Price Data:**
- 100% availability for found tokens
- But only 1 unique token discovered

### Wallet 2: 34zYDgjy8oinZ5y8gyrcQktzUmSfFLJztTSq5xLUVCya

**Transaction Analysis:**
```
Total SWAP transactions: 33
Has swap event: 8 (24%)
Missing swap event: 25 (76%)
Multi-hop swaps: 0
Sources: RAYDIUM only
```

**Price Data:**
- 87.5% availability for found tokens
- Only 2 unique tokens discovered
- 1 pump.fun token without price data

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Incomplete DEX Coverage**
- Only RAYDIUM swaps have proper `events.swap` data
- PUMP_AMM, Jupiter, Orca, and other DEXs are either:
  - Marked as SWAP but missing event data
  - Not captured at all
  - Categorized as different transaction types

### 2. **Event Parsing Limitations**
- 76-80% of SWAP transactions lack standardized swap events
- Current code relies on `events.swap` which most DEXs don't emit
- Need to parse raw instruction data for many DEXs

### 3. **Historical Data Depth**
- API returns limited recent history
- Need pagination to access full trading history
- May need to use different endpoints for complete data

### 4. **Transaction Type Misclassification**
- Many swaps might be classified as TRANSFER or other types
- Need broader search beyond just type=SWAP

## Implications

Your current v3 code is missing **95%+ of trading activity** because:
1. It only processes transactions with `events.swap`
2. It doesn't handle DEX-specific formats
3. It's not paginating through full history

## Recommendations

1. **Implement v4 improvements** as suggested by your friend:
   - Use server-side filters but also check other transaction types
   - Parse innerSwaps for multi-hop trades
   - Handle DEX-specific transaction formats
   - Implement proper pagination

2. **Expand DEX Support**:
   - Parse PUMP_AMM transactions differently
   - Add Jupiter, Orca, Phoenix parsers
   - Handle wrapped SOL operations

3. **Complete History Retrieval**:
   - Use getSignaturesForAddress for completeness
   - Implement pagination to get all historical data
   - Process transactions in batches

4. **Robust Event Parsing**:
   - Don't rely solely on `events.swap`
   - Parse instruction data when events are missing
   - Handle DEX-specific formats

The good news: Price data availability is high (87-100%) for tokens that are properly detected. The main issue is transaction discovery and parsing, not pricing.
