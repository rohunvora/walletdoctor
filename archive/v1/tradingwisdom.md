Collecting best trading knowledge

On-chain trading is a war of information.
No matter your breed (see monkey & fish thread), the difference between a gambler and a trader is a system, and all systems are built on information.

A system is simply a set of rules:
I will always buy if X.
I will always sell if Y.
And so on.

The edge of your blade comes down to two factors:

1. The quality of your information
2. Your reaction to information

The concept of the unseen blade is about finding information others don’t have - or aren’t paying attention to.

This can come from technical tools that see beyond terminals, obsessive collection of onchain crumbles, social research that looks toward the future rather than the past, or simply stepping back and thinking creatively.

Am I monitoring what everyone else is?

Both the freshie hunter quant and the dopamine addict TikTok enjoyer hold a blade, there is no excuse.

Those trapped in the herd’s point of view are usually left competing in a game of who clicks first.
Put yourself around individuals who understand this, and if you can't - educate them to.

The unseen blade doesn’t react to opportunity.
It creates it with patience and purpose.

The unseen blade is the deadliest.

**The Good/Bad Methodology**
As traders - we gather rules, ideas, and systems with one simple goal: to stay consistent.
A lesson I wish I understood earlier is that there are only 4 types of trades:
Good win, good loss, bad win, and bad loss.

**The Good Win**
The best. You followed your system and rules, had a thesis you built yourself, and watched your idea play out as expected with a green PnL.
While everyone else is still debating what you understood a long time ago, you eat comfortably.
This is when you should pat yourself on the back and let your ego grow. You've earned it.

**The Good Loss**

You followed your system and trusted your thesis, but it didn’t work out.
Something unpredictable or out of your control happened, or market just did not agree with your idea.
This is when you should be kind to yourself. There’s no shame in a good loss.

**The Bad Win**

You broke your rules, acted on emotion or carelessness - but got lucky. Elon replied to some random tweet and the tech you blindly ‘top blasted’ / copy-traded became ground breaking.
Enjoy sure, but don't celebrate.

**The Bad Loss**

Driven by emotion, you abandoned your system. Small gaps of laziness and wealth waved goodbye.
It's important to be hard on yourself when this happens.

**Why?**

Our ego as a traders plays a crucial role in our progress. It’s the inner balance which facilitates discipline. 
Learning to recognize good and bad regardless of profit or loss - helps keeps a healthy ego which often translate to consistent trading.

Next time you close a trade - use this methodology to reflect.

Be loyal to your system.
Stay humble.
Cats are cute.

The Fish & Monkey Methodology

I believe we all have a trading nature.
Some are fish - they aim to reach the shore every day. They prioritize consistent gains over life changing stories.
Others are monkeys – they want it big, and exciting.

The first step is understanding your core.
Once you know your nature, the next step is to stay loyal to it.

Loyalty purely means avoiding useless cope.

If I’m a monkey, I don’t cope over roundtripping.
If I’m a fish, I don’t cope over papering moonshots.

When you truly own that, you can start adapting to stages in the market as different markets reward different breeds.

A fish can stay a fish but in a 'believers market', he might add " always keep a 10% moonbag" to his system.
A monkey can stay a monkey, but in a 'jeet market', he might add "always secure initials" to his system.

Fish cry on trees, ︀︀monkeys scream in the ocean - ︀︀keep loyal to your system or be raped by the cat.

what does it mean to be an onchain trader?

in order to improve your navigation of these markets, it's important to understand what your role is in the first place. with onchain assets largely having little to no fundamental value, the "trade" lies entirely in the process of speculation

if you are a pumpfunner, you get paid for putting in the time and effort to filter through the hundreds if not thousands of new coins. essentially a "finder's fee" for your work. while tedious, it's the best way to build your starting bankroll. the downside however is it's near impossible to see the potential of coins you're buying when you're so zoomed in. you want to transition out of this style as soon as you can

if you want bigger returns, it can't be as simple as just linearly trading your time. for most, the game is really about who can best appraise the value of a coin on a longer timeframe. what is the coin currently valued at? what do you think it should be valued at and why? how much of that difference in value can you successfully arbitrage? a good trader should aim to extract at least 50% of a coin's total possible return on their investment. if a coin 10Xs, your goal is to secure at least 5X on what you put in. obviously, this is the hardest part of onchain and exactly why it's the most rewarding. there is no easy way to tell how much a coin should be worth when there are no fundamentals like cashflow to extrapolate from

at the root of it, onchain trading is all about different forms of arbitrage. the beauty of such a new and emerging market is all the inefficiencies that come with it. if everyone knows what to look at or if everyone agrees on the thesis of a trade, there's very little money left on the table. find a specific inefficiency in the market that you can consistently close the gap on, whether it's taking risk faster than others, or simply putting in the time and effort to look at deploys. visualize the flow of speculation that occurs during the lifecycle of a coin and identify which area you will profit from. there is no right way to make money, there is only the way that suits you best

"he who chases two rabbits catches neither"

too often people make some money in their original niche and try to branch out to other sectors of crypto. shitcoiners trading perps has been a common trope

besides the obvious disadvantages of playing in a different game where you have little to no edge, the opportunity and mental cost is what really hurts. it's easy to think that doing more will increase your overall pnl, but in reality you'd make more just doubling down on what you're already profitable at. by diluting your mental energy, you'll find yourself struggling with conviction on your perp trades, while also missing/fumbling your onchain spots. mental clarity is one of the most important factors to execute highly profitable trades, so how can you focus on finding and holding that 100x when you're distracted by some random long on an irrelevant alt?

there are an infinite amount of trades every day in crypto, it's important to be aware of that while also accepting that you're not going to catch them all. it's okay to miss other opportunities as long as you're catching and maximizing the select few that match your skillset. "this alt is being short squeezed!" who fucking cares? were you ever going to take that trade or recognize it in advance? stop wasting mental energy on irrelevant trades and what-ifs. making yourself feel bad over trades you never would have touched in the first place doesn't help you get better. on the other hand, if you fumbled an important launch that you saw early and should have played better, you should feel bad about that and learn from it

focus on your strengths, keep refining your edge, accept that you won't catch everything, hit the trades you should, then try to hit them even better next time

less is more

a common pitfall that stunts many trader's growth is an over-reliance on tooling. take wallet tracking as an example

it's easy to think that adding more wallets to your list gives you more alpha. "I can track what all these good traders are doing and print!" but how much information is too much information? if you see everything, you see nothing. there is an incredibly fine line between alpha and noise. are the traders you're tracking simply getting lucky with a spray and pray approach? or are they profitable just because they farm their copytraders? try to narrow down your list to a few wallets that actually have some semblance of reasoning in their trades. for most, the best usage of wallet tracking is a select few as confluence and relevant deployers/insiders to the coin you're currently trading

noise is your biggest enemy. the best trades often stare you right in the face for a long time. if everyone agreed a trade was good from the start then there would be no trade at all. what inefficiency is there to close? instead of flooding your system with excess information, streamline it down to the basics and focus on the fundamentals. what is this coin? how much could it be worth? how much should I buy? when should I sell?

### misc.

The best advice I can give a trader who is aiming to be profitable is this…

To SELL …. you must be sure that you are selling into a place that has CLEAR price action.

Same goes for buys.

Once you do this and avoid selling or buying into regions without clear price action then I bet you that your profitability goes off the roof.

Trading isn’t hard… It is the absence of discipline that makes it HARD.

My biggest trading advice would be this:
Shift your value system, from aiming to make money to aiming to be efficient on every single trade.
Each trade is an independent transaction of the previous order, the goal is to be efficient in decision making irrespective of win/loss.

You way you lose stems from how you achieved your biggest wins

Your habits die with you

Eg
A huge win from gambling on AI tek without understanding it -> You lose from doing it overtime
Diamond-handed a community animal token to insane valuations -> Lose it trying to catch the next one numerous times
Scalped hundreds of coins a day during high volume -> Burnt out during dead volume

Study the ones who got lucky near the end of 2024 with the AI mania, those who roundtripped majority of their coins after coinbase/ binance listings, and their habits of trying to do it over and over again

It’s easy to be “good” in a when the market is good.

Some thoughts coming from someone who’s been here through two cycles now

First off, no matter how you played the last X amount of months / years, whatever $ amount you’re left with now should be protected and thought of as a ‘base’ for your portfolio going forward. You should do your very best to not drop below this amount IMO. It is obvious there’s a shift in the market now, it’s important to understand that and be more defensive for the time being

Do not chase in an attempt to make back any round tripped gains. This will lead to your portfolio bleeding further and it becoming a downward spiral effect for most of you

Use this time to build your brand / network and sharpen your skills outside of just clicking buy / sell. I’ve grown my business and brand since the 2020 bull market, from zero to an eight figure dollar brand / company now. This is something any of you can do if you desire it enough and want to put in the effort

You must be very selective with plays going forward for the foreseeable future. Just a few weeks ago a loss could easily be made back on the next play, that’s no longer the case now - opportunity is still there and will continue to be but is more scarce now

Don’t beat yourself up or compare yourself to other people, 99% of the people you probably look up to have put in a shit ton of work to get where they’re at. There is without a doubt going to be a time where opportunity runs rampant again in this market. When? IDK. It’ll come though and grinding through the slow periods will pay off

Your journey is not the same as anyone else’s, you don’t need to make X amount of money in X amount of time to ‘make it’. Take things slowly and focus on the long term horizon
