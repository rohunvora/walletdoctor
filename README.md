**You**: *enters 3x normal position size*

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Key areas:
- Improving pattern detection
- Adding new conversation templates
- Enhancing P&L accuracy
- Building the context-aware AI layer

## üìö Documentation

- [Bot Management Guide](BOT_MANAGEMENT.md) - Start/stop/monitor the bot
- [Testing Guide](TESTING_GUIDE.md) - How to test changes
- [Architecture Details](.cursor/scratchpad.md) - Internal documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

The bot uses rule-based logic which can sometimes:
- Misclassify user intent ("cut position" while in profit)
- Show incorrect P&L data (API limitations)
- Feel repetitive despite state management

We're building a context-aware AI layer to address these issues.
