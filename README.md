- **Overtrading Alerts**: When you're gambling, not trading
- **Win Rate Reality**: No sugar coating, just facts

## Features

- **Real-time Trade Monitoring**: Detects swaps within 5 seconds
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies repeat tokens, position sizing, hold times
- **Conversational Nudges**: Asks thoughtful questions, not generic alerts
- **P&L Integration**: Shows realized and unrealized profit/loss
- **Trade Notes**: Annotate trades to help the bot learn your style
- **Personal Stats**: Track your win rate, average hold times, and patterns

## State-Based Memory System

The bot uses a sophisticated state management system to ensure conversations feel natural and never repetitive:

- **Token Notebooks**: Maintains conversation state for each token you trade
- **No Duplicate Questions**: Won't ask the same question twice until you answer
- **Risk Context**: Automatically adds portfolio exposure or P&L context when relevant
- **Persistent Memory**: Survives bot restarts and remembers all conversations
- **User Isolation**: Each user has completely separate conversation state

Example:
- First BONK trade: "BONK again? What's different this time?"
- Second BONK trade: [No question - waiting for your answer]
- High exposure trade: "You're at 22% of bankroll in VIBE‚Äîsame whale thesis?"
