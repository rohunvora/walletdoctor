# WAL-314 Completion: Fix Infinite Pagination

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Implementation Date**: Dec 20, 2024

## Summary
Fixed infinite pagination by implementing a hard cap of 150 pages and increasing consecutive empty page tolerance from 3 to 5.

## Changes Made

### src/lib/blockchain_fetcher_v3.py
1. **Added hard cap check**: Stops pagination at 150 pages with ERROR log
2. **Increased empty page tolerance**: Changed from 3 to 5 consecutive empty pages
3. **Added warning at 100 pages**: Now properly triggers when crossing 100 (not just at exactly 100)
4. **Added safety check in batch size calculation**: Prevents fetching beyond 150 pages

## Key Improvements
- **Hard cap enforcement**: No wallet can fetch more than 150 pages
- **Better warning logic**: Uses `warned_100_pages` flag to trigger when crossing 100 pages threshold
- **Batch-aware checks**: Warning can trigger both at batch start and during page processing
- **Clear error messaging**: "ERROR: Hit 150 page hard cap, stopping"

## Test Results
```
ERROR:src.lib.blockchain_fetcher_v3:Hit hard cap of 150 pages for wallet..., stopping pagination
ERROR: Hit 150 page hard cap, stopping
Parallel fetch complete: 6320 total transactions in 150 pages
✓ PASSED: Stayed within 150 page limit
```

## Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ Page counter properly tracks total pages
- ✅ Terminates on 5 consecutive empty pages (increased from 3)
- ✅ Terminates at 150 pages hard cap
- ✅ Logs WARNING when crossing 100 pages
- ✅ Logs ERROR at 150 pages
- ✅ Performance test confirms page count ≤ 150

## Notes
- The warning now triggers when crossing 100 pages, not just at exactly page 100
- This handles batch fetching where we might jump from page 91 to 111
- The 5 consecutive empty page limit gives more tolerance for sparse data
- Hard cap of 150 pages prevents infinite loops even with buggy API responses
