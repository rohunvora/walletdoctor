# Deep psychological pattern rules - connects multiple metrics to reveal hidden behaviors

# PATTERN: Loss Aversion Asymmetry
loss_aversion_pattern:
  type: composite
  metrics:
    - avg_winner_hold_time
    - avg_loser_hold_time
  condition: "loser_time > winner_time * 1.2"
  template: >
    You hold losers {loser_pct:.0f}% longer than winners. This isn't random—it's 
    textbook loss aversion. You fear locking in losses more than missing gains. 
    Every minute past your winner hold time is ego protection, not strategy.

# PATTERN: Profitable Despite Yourself
lucky_gambler_pattern:
  type: composite
  metrics:
    - win_rate
    - profit_factor
  condition: "win_rate < 30 AND profit_factor > 1.0"
  template: >
    26% win rate with profit? You're not good—you're lucky. You found a few 
    10-baggers that covered for 74% failed bets. This isn't skill, it's 
    survivorship bias. When luck runs out, you'll blow up.

# PATTERN: Revenge Trading Signature
revenge_spiral_pattern:
  type: composite
  metrics:
    - position_sizing_variance
    - largest_loss
    - median_trade_size
  condition: "largest_loss > median_size * 10 AND variance > 1000"
  template: >
    Your largest loss is {loss_multiplier:.0f}x your normal trade size. Classic 
    revenge trading: small loss → double down → massive loss → repeat. You're 
    not trading, you're trying to "get even" with the market.

# PATTERN: No Process Indicator
chaos_trader_pattern:
  type: composite
  metrics:
    - position_sizing_variance
    - hold_time_variance
    - time_between_trades_variance
  condition: "all_variances > 100"
  template: >
    Your trading has zero consistency. Position sizes, hold times, entry 
    timing—all random. You don't have a strategy, you have impulses. The 
    market rewards discipline, not YOLO.

  severity: high

# PATTERN: FOMO Cycle Detection
fomo_chaser_pattern:
  type: sequence
  looks_for: "win → rapid_entries → losses"
  template: >
    After big wins, you enter {fomo_trades} trades within {time_window}. 
    You're not following setups—you're chasing the high of your last win. 
    FOMO trading after wins causes {pct_of_losses:.0f}% of your losses.

# SINGLE METRIC RULES (but with psychological insight)

fragile_confidence:
  threshold: 60  # minutes
  applies_to: avg_winner_hold_time
  condition: "value < threshold"
  template: >
    {value:.0f} minute average on winners? You don't trust your own picks. 
    Either your entries are random (so you know they'll reverse) or you're 
    so scarred by past losses that you sabotage wins. Which is it?
  weight: 0.75
  severity: high

hope_trader:
  threshold: 300  # minutes  
  applies_to: avg_loser_hold_time
  condition: "value > threshold"
  template: >
    {value:.0f} minutes watching positions bleed. Hope isn't a strategy. 
    You're not "being patient"—you're avoiding the pain of admitting you're 
    wrong. Every minute past -5% is denial.
  weight: 0.75
  severity: high

size_chaos:
  threshold: 500  # % variance
  applies_to: position_sizing_variance
  condition: "value > threshold"
  template: >
    {value:.0f}% position size variance means you size based on emotion, not 
    math. Big size when you're desperate, small when you're scared. This 
    isn't trading—it's gambling with extra steps.

# INSIGHTS WITH HARSH TRUTHS

reality_check_low_win_rate:
  threshold: 30
  applies_to: win_rate
  condition: "value < threshold"
  template: >
    {value:.0f}% win rate. Let's be clear: 3 out of 4 times, you're wrong. 
    Not unlucky—WRONG. Either your analysis is garbage or you're buying 
    every pump. Pick one to fix.

  severity: high
  harsh: true

greed_kills_profit_factor:
  threshold: 1.5
  applies_to: profit_factor
  condition: "value < threshold AND win_rate < 40"
  template: >
    Low win rate + marginal profit factor = you're one bad streak from zero. 
    Your "edge" is finding moonshots. When they dry up, so does your account.

# ACTION-ORIENTED INSIGHTS

immediate_action_required:
  triggers_when: "any_critical_severity"
  template: >
    STOP. Before your next trade: 1) Calculate 2% of your portfolio. 2) That's 
    your max position size for 30 days. 3) Break this rule = quit trading. 
    You need guardrails before you blow up.
