# WAL-613 Helius-Only Pricing - Final Status

## âœ… Root Cause Found & Fixed

### The Problem
- `PRICE_HELIUS_ONLY=true` was set in Railway environment
- BUT Birdeye was still being called (batches 259-285 with 404s)
- Requests were timing out after 45+ seconds

### The Root Cause
`BlockchainFetcherV3Fast` was checking `skip_pricing` but NOT `PRICE_HELIUS_ONLY`:
```python
# OLD CODE (incorrect)
if not self.skip_pricing:
    await self._fetch_prices_batch(filtered_trades)  # Always calls Birdeye!
```

### The Fix
```python
# NEW CODE (correct)
if os.getenv('PRICE_HELIUS_ONLY', '').lower() == 'true':
    self._report_progress("Skipping Birdeye - using Helius-only pricing")
elif not self.skip_pricing:
    await self._fetch_prices_batch(filtered_trades)
```

## ðŸš€ Ready to Deploy

### Changes Pushed
- **Commit**: `891d996` - fix(WAL-613): Fix PRICE_HELIUS_ONLY check in BlockchainFetcherV3Fast
- **Branch**: main

### What Will Happen After Deploy

1. **Startup Log**:
   ```
   [BOOT] PRICE_HELIUS_ONLY: true
   ```

2. **Request Flow**:
   ```
   [REQUEST] export-gpt called for 34zYDgjy...
   [REQUEST] PRICE_HELIUS_ONLY=true
   [PHASE] Starting trade fetch...
   Skipping Birdeye - using Helius-only pricing  <-- Key line!
   [PHASE] helius_fetch completed in X.XXs
   [PRICE] Helius-only mode: XXX transactions available
   ```

3. **Performance**:
   - Target: <8s cold, <0.5s warm
   - No more 45+ second timeouts

### Side Note: Birdeye 404s
The 404 errors were happening because Birdeye was being called with single-token batches for potentially invalid/old mint addresses. This will stop entirely with Helius-only mode.

## Test After Deploy

```bash
# Quick test (10s timeout)
curl -H "X-Api-Key: wd_12345678901234567890123456789012" \
  "https://web-production-2bb2f.up.railway.app/v4/positions/export-gpt/34zYDgjy8oinZ5y8gyrcQktzUmSfFLJztTSq5xLUVCya" \
  -m 10

# Check logs
railway logs --tail 100 | grep -E '\[BOOT\]|\[PHASE\]|\[PRICE\]|Skipping Birdeye'
```

## Status
âœ… **CODE FIXED** - Redeploy to activate Helius-only pricing
