print("""1. PATTERN: You hold losers 27% longer than winners (373 vs 293 min)
   WHY: Classic loss aversion. You can't admit you're wrong.
   SUBCONSCIOUS: "If I don't sell, it's not a real loss"
   FIX: Hard stop at -5%. No exceptions. Your ego isn't worth $59K.

2. PATTERN: 26% win rate BUT 1.31 profit factor 
   WHY: You're not bad at finding winners‚Äîyou found GOONC (+$204K).
       You're bad at everything else.
   SUBCONSCIOUS: "I just need one big win to make it all back"
   FIX: You're not a VC. Stop betting like one.

3. PATTERN: 2,808% position variance + $59K loss
   WHY: After small losses, you 10x your size to "get even"
   SUBCONSCIOUS: "The market owes me"
   FIX: The market owes you nothing. Max 2% per trade or quit.

THE REAL PROBLEM: You're not trading‚Äîyou're in a toxic relationship
with the market. You hold losers like an ex you can't let go. You
revenge trade like you're settling a score. You cut winners early
because you don't believe you deserve them.

This isn't about strategy. It's about psychology.
Fix your mind or the market will break it.""")
