# WAL-602 Completion: Cost Basis Calculator

## Summary
Successfully implemented a comprehensive cost basis calculator supporting both FIFO and Weighted Average methods, with full edge case handling and property-based testing.

## Delivered Components

### 1. Cost Basis Calculator (`src/lib/cost_basis_calculator.py`)
- **FIFO Implementation**: First-In-First-Out cost basis calculation
  - Tracks remaining amounts per buy for accurate FIFO ordering
  - Handles partial sells and insufficient buy history
  - Maintains chronological order for tax compliance
  
- **Weighted Average Implementation**: Average cost across all purchases
  - Simple calculation for all holdings
  - Order-independent (property tested)
  - Commonly used for crypto portfolios

- **Position Cost Basis**: Calculate basis for current holdings
  - Handles both methods appropriately
  - Special handling for positions after partial sells
  
- **Realized P&L Calculation**: Compute gains/losses on sells
  - Integrates with both cost basis methods
  - Returns detailed result with notes

### 2. Data Structures
- **BuyRecord**: Tracks individual purchases
  - Timestamps, amounts, prices, remaining amounts
  - Factory method `from_trade()` for easy creation
  
- **CostBasisResult**: Comprehensive calculation results
  - Per-token and total USD cost basis
  - Method used and explanatory notes
  - Optional realized P&L

### 3. Edge Case Handling ✅
All edge cases from the design document are handled:
- **Airdrops**: Zero cost basis, treated appropriately
- **Dust Amounts**: Threshold of $0.01, ignored in calculations
- **Mixed Purchases**: Airdrops + purchases handled correctly
- **Large/Small Numbers**: Tested with extreme values
- **Insufficient History**: Graceful handling with warnings
- **Zero Balance**: Closed positions return zero basis

### 4. Property-Based Testing with Hypothesis ✅
28 comprehensive tests including:
- **Property Tests**:
  - FIFO cost basis never negative
  - Weighted average order-independent
  - P&L consistency (revenue - cost = P&L)
  - FIFO order sensitivity
  
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Both calculation methods
  - Position calculations
  - Realized P&L
  - Edge cases
  - Buy record updates

**All tests passing** ✅

## Technical Decisions

1. **Decimal Precision**: 8 decimal places for per-token values, 2 for USD
2. **Rounding**: ROUND_DOWN to avoid overstatement
3. **FIFO Tracking**: Maintains `remaining_amount` per buy
4. **Feature Flag Integration**: Respects `COST_BASIS_METHOD` env var
5. **Notes System**: Provides transparency on calculations

## Code Examples

### FIFO Calculation
```python
calc = CostBasisCalculator(CostBasisMethod.FIFO)
buys = [
    BuyRecord(timestamp=dt1, amount=100, price_per_token=1.0, ...),
    BuyRecord(timestamp=dt2, amount=100, price_per_token=2.0, ...)
]
# Sell 150 tokens
result = calc.calculate_fifo(buys, Decimal("150"))
# Uses all 100 @ $1 + 50 @ $2 = $200 cost basis
```

### Weighted Average
```python
calc = CostBasisCalculator(CostBasisMethod.WEIGHTED_AVG)
result = calc.calculate_weighted_average(buys)
# (100 * $1 + 100 * $2) / 200 = $1.50 per token
```

### Position Calculation
```python
# Calculate basis for current holdings
result = calc.calculate_for_position(buys, current_balance=Decimal("50"))
# Handles airdrops, dust, and method-specific logic
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **FIFO**: O(n) where n = number of buys
- **Weighted Average**: O(n) single pass
- **Memory**: O(n) for buy records
- **Precision**: Exact to 8 decimal places

## Testing Summary
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_cost_basis_calculator.py -v
# Result: 28 passed in 0.56s
```

Property-based tests with Hypothesis ensure robustness across:
- Random buy/sell amounts
- Various price ranges
- Different timing scenarios
- Edge cases and extremes

## Next Steps

With cost basis calculation complete, ready for:
- WAL-603: Position Builder Service (uses calculator)
- WAL-604: Unrealized P&L Calculator (needs positions)

The calculator is feature-flag protected and ready for integration.
