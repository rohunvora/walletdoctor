# Daily Status - July 2, 2025

## 🎯 Today's Achievement
Successfully debugged and fixed WAL-613 - the GPT export endpoint 500 errors.

## 🔍 Key Discovery
The 500 errors were NOT caused by Birdeye pricing issues. The actual root cause was invalid `value_usd` fields in trade data causing decimal conversion failures.

## ✅ Completed
1. **Fixed decimal conversion error** in `cost_basis_calculator.py`
2. **Verified Helius-only pricing** is working correctly
3. **Deployed to Railway** at https://web-production-2bb2f.up.railway.app/
4. **Added comprehensive instrumentation** with [CHECK] and [FATAL] logging

## 📊 Current Performance
- **Cold cache**: 3.36s ✅ (meets < 8s target)
- **Warm cache**: 2.49s ❌ (misses < 0.5s target)

## 🚧 Outstanding Issues
1. **Warm cache performance** - Redis not being utilized effectively
2. **404 errors** - Some wallets returning "no trading data found"
3. **Test failures** - Some unit tests failing due to missing env vars

## 📅 Tomorrow's Priority
1. Configure Redis for persistent caching
2. Debug warm cache performance issue
3. Investigate 404 errors for known active wallets
4. Begin Phase B optimizations
