1. Trading frequency and volume patterns
2. Token preferences and diversification
3. DEX usage patterns
4. Time-based trading behavior
5. Buy/sell ratios and strategy indicators

Present insights in a conversational, helpful tone. Use emojis sparingly for clarity. Always end with a question to engage further analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Your Trading Activity Analysis

I've analyzed your 1,107 trades and here's what stands out:

### Trading Style
You're an active trader averaging 46 trades per day with a clear buying bias (1.85 buy/sell ratio). Your total volume of 19,082 SOL shows significant market participation.

### Timing Patterns  
You're most active during:
- 7:00 UTC (82 trades) - Early European morning
- 3:00 UTC (71 trades) - Late US evening  
- 21:00 UTC (71 trades) - US afternoon

This suggests you're either trading across time zones or using automated strategies during off-peak hours.

### DEX Strategy
Your DEX usage is well-distributed:
- METEORA: 30.1% (good for stable pairs)
- SYSTEM_PROGRAM: 28.4% (direct transfers)
- PUMP_AMM: 23.8% (new token launches)

This diversification helps with slippage and access to different liquidity pools.

### Token Focus
Your top 5 tokens account for significant volume:
- CfVs3waH: Heavy accumulation (343 buys vs 12 sells)
- EPjFWdd5: More balanced (31 buys, 20 sells)
- 3dk9CNre: Moderate accumulation pattern

The strong buy bias on CfVs3waH suggests either building a position or averaging down.

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific token's trading pattern or analyze a particular time period?

## Prompt Engineering Tips

1. **Without P&L Data**: Focus on volume, frequency, and patterns rather than profitability
2. **Token Names**: Use shortened token addresses when symbols aren't available
3. **Actionable Insights**: Always suggest what the patterns might mean
4. **Engagement**: End with specific questions to guide further analysis

## Size Limits

Keep responses under 2KB to ensure smooth ChatGPT interactions:
- Limit token analysis to top 5-7
- Summarize time patterns rather than listing all hours
- Focus on most significant findings

## Future Enhancement

Once TRD-002 is implemented with price/P&L data, these prompts can be extended to include:
- Win rate analysis
- Profit/loss patterns
- Risk metrics
- Position sizing recommendations
