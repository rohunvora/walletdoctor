# Beta Validation Status

## Railway Performance Update (2025-07-02)
- Small wallet (145 trades): 502 timeout @ 5.1s
- Railway proxy timing out before app responds
- Need to set RAILWAY_PROXY_TIMEOUT=30 and optimize Helius fetching
- See tmp/railway_timing_summary.md for details

## Date: January 2, 2025

### What We Did

1. **Slimmed Validation Set**
   - Updated all test scripts to use only small wallet (145 trades)
   - Commented out medium (380 trades) and large (6,424 trades) wallets
   - Added TODO markers for re-enabling when performance is fixed

2. **Updated Files**
   - `scripts/test_cache_warming.py` - Only tests small wallet
   - `scripts/profile_gpt_export.py` - Only profiles small wallet
   - `scripts/profile_gpt_export_remote.py` - Only tests small wallet remotely
   - `src/lib/performance_validator.py` - Disabled medium/large test wallets
   - `test_production_readiness.py` - Uses small wallet
   - `test_ci_sse_performance.py` - Uses small wallet
   - `README.md` - Added beta testing configuration note
   - `docs/gpt_action/GPT_ROUNDTRIP_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Updated with beta status

### Current Status

**ðŸ”´ Blocked by Railway Deployment**
- Even small wallet (145 trades) times out after 35s
- Health endpoint works fine
- Any endpoint that fetches blockchain data fails
- Likely issues:
  - Helius API key not set or invalid
  - Rate limiting on free tier
  - Network connectivity from Railway to Helius

### Performance Targets

For the small wallet (145 trades):
- **Cold cache**: <5s (currently: timeout)
- **Warm cache**: <200ms (currently: N/A)
- **Railway limit**: 30s
- **ChatGPT limit**: 30s

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate (to unblock testing)**
   - Check Railway environment variables
   - Verify Helius API key is valid and has credits
   - Consider alternative deployment (Render, Fly.io)
   - Create mock endpoint for GPT testing

2. **Short-term (once unblocked)**
   - Get small wallet working under 5s
   - Test cache warming functionality
   - Validate GPT roundtrip with real ChatGPT

3. **Medium-term (after beta)**
   - Re-enable medium wallet (380 trades)
   - Re-enable large wallet (6,424 trades)
   - Full performance validation suite

### WAL-613 Readiness

Despite Railway issues, we're ready for WAL-613 (test harness) because:
- âœ… Code implementations are complete
- âœ… Cache warming endpoint implemented
- âœ… SSE streaming endpoint implemented
- âœ… Test scripts updated for beta scope
- âœ… Documentation updated

The Railway deployment issue is infrastructure-related, not a code problem.

### Recommendations

1. **For immediate progress**: Deploy to alternative platform or fix Railway config
2. **For GPT testing**: Use mock data endpoint temporarily
3. **For WAL-613**: Proceed with test harness development in parallel

**Status**: Ready for WAL-613, but beta validation blocked by deployment issues
