# WAL-311: Add Semaphore Rate Limiter - COMPLETE ✅

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Created `RateLimitedFetcher` Class
- Added new class in `blockchain_fetcher_v3.py` using `asyncio.Semaphore(10)`
- Implements async context manager pattern (`__aenter__` / `__aexit__`)
- Tracks active requests, total requests, and rate limit hits
- Provides statistics via `.stats` property

### 2. Integrated with BlockchainFetcherV3
- Added `self.helius_rate_limited_fetcher` instance to constructor
- Modified `_fetch_swap_transactions()` to use semaphore for page fetching
- Modified `_fetch_token_metadata()` to use semaphore for metadata requests

### 3. Key Features
- **Concurrent Limit**: Enforces max 10 concurrent Helius requests
- **Queue Management**: Additional requests wait for semaphore availability
- **No Request Loss**: All requests eventually execute
- **Statistics Tracking**: Monitor active requests and rate limit hits

## Test Results

### Concurrent Limit Test (10 max)
- Sent 20 concurrent requests
- First 10 acquired immediately (0.00s)
- Next 10 waited ~0.89s for first batch to complete
- ✅ Correctly enforced 10 concurrent limit

### Smaller Limit Test (3 max)
- Sent 9 concurrent requests with 0.5s duration
- Batch 1: 3 requests (immediate)
- Batch 2: 3 requests (waited ~0.47s)
- Batch 3: 3 requests (waited ~0.94s)
- ✅ Properly queued in batches

## Implementation Pattern

```python
# Before (time-based rate limiting)
await self.helius_limiter.acquire()
async with self.session.get(...) as resp:
    # Make request

# After (semaphore-based rate limiting)
async with self.helius_rate_limited_fetcher:
    async with self.session.get(...) as resp:
        # Make request
```

## Benefits
1. **True Concurrency Control**: Limits actual concurrent connections, not just request rate
2. **Better Resource Usage**: Can have 10 requests in-flight simultaneously
3. **Preparation for Parallel Fetching**: Essential foundation for WAL-312
4. **No Request Dropping**: All requests queued and eventually processed

## Next Steps
This semaphore implementation is the foundation for WAL-312 (parallel page fetching), where we'll use this rate limiter to safely fetch multiple pages concurrently while respecting Helius limits.
