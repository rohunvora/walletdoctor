# WAL-609: Memory-Leak Guardrail - COMPLETION

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**  
**Completion Date:** December 20, 2024  
**Estimated Hours:** 4h  
**Actual Hours:** ~4h  

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive memory leak guardrail system with self-check endpoints, auto-restart capabilities, and load testing validation for WalletDoctor's V4 position tracking API.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Memory Guardrail System (`src/lib/memory_guardrail.py`)
- **MemoryGuardrail Class**: Core leak detection and monitoring system
- **Snapshot Collection**: Real-time memory and cache usage tracking
- **Baseline Establishment**: Automatic baseline memory profiling (10 samples)
- **Leak Detection**: Linear regression-based growth rate analysis (5MB/min threshold)
- **Auto-restart Logic**: Configurable triggers for RSS (700MB) and cache (2.2k entries) thresholds
- **Graceful Shutdown**: SIGTERM handling with final state logging

#### Configuration Options:
```bash
MEMORY_RSS_THRESHOLD_MB=700        # RSS memory limit
CACHE_ENTRIES_THRESHOLD=2200       # Cache size limit  
AUTO_RESTART_ENABLED=false         # Enable auto-restart
MEMORY_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC=60       # Check frequency
BASELINE_SAMPLE_COUNT=10           # Samples for baseline
LEAK_DETECTION_WINDOW_MIN=10       # Detection window
```

### 2. Enhanced V4 API (`src/api/wallet_analytics_api_v4_guardrail.py`)
Extended the metrics-enabled V4 API with 7 new guardrail endpoints:

#### Core Endpoints:
- **`GET /self-check`**: Primary monitoring endpoint (required by WAL-609)
  - Returns current memory, cache stats, threshold status
  - HTTP status codes: 200 (healthy), 206 (warning), 503 (critical)
  - Includes restart recommendations and response timing

- **`GET /self-check/memory`**: Memory-focused diagnostics
  - Detailed RSS/VMS memory statistics
  - Leak detection results with growth rates
  - Time-to-threshold predictions

- **`GET /self-check/cache`**: Cache health monitoring
  - Position cache statistics and usage percentage
  - Detailed cache performance metrics
  - Threshold violation alerts

- **`GET /self-check/baseline`**: Load testing support
  - Baseline establishment and validation
  - Growth tracking with acceptance criteria
  - WAL-609 compliance reporting (+50MB limit)

#### Operational Endpoints:
- **`POST /self-check/restart`**: Manual restart trigger (requires confirmation)
- **`POST /self-check/force-memory-check`**: Manual memory check execution
- **`GET /self-check/detailed`**: Comprehensive debugging statistics

### 3. Load Testing Framework (`scripts/test_memory_guardrail_load.py`)
Automated validation tool for WAL-609 acceptance criteria:

#### Test Configuration:
- **Duration**: 10 minutes sustained load
- **Rate**: 5 requests/second (3000 total requests)
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Memory growth < +50MB, P95 latency < 200ms
- **Baseline Support**: Automatic warm-up and baseline establishment

#### Usage:
```bash
# Run load test
python scripts/test_memory_guardrail_load.py --host localhost --port 5000

# Verbose mode with output file
python scripts/test_memory_guardrail_load.py -v --output load_test_results.json
```

#### Sample Output:
```
WAL-609 Memory Guardrail Load Test Report
========================================

Test Configuration:
  Duration: 10 minutes
  Target Rate: 5 req/s
  Total Requests: 3000
  Success Rate: 100.0%

Memory Results:
  Baseline RSS: 45.2 MB
  Initial RSS: 45.8 MB
  Final RSS: 67.3 MB
  Memory Growth: 21.5 MB
  Memory Range: 28.1 MB

Acceptance Criteria:
  Memory Growth < 50MB: ✓ PASS (21.5MB)
  P95 Latency < 200ms: ✓ PASS (145.2ms)

OVERALL RESULT: PASS
```

### 4. Comprehensive Testing (`tests/test_memory_guardrail.py`)
Unit test coverage for critical functionality:

#### Test Categories:
- **Snapshot Collection**: Memory and cache data capture
- **Baseline Establishment**: Automatic profiling logic
- **Growth Rate Calculation**: Linear regression accuracy  
- **Threshold Monitoring**: RSS and cache limit detection
- **Auto-restart Logic**: Trigger conditions and rate limiting
- **Load Test Validation**: Acceptance criteria compliance
- **Performance**: <10ms snapshot collection, efficient cleanup

#### Key Test Results:
```python
def test_load_test_acceptance_criteria():
    # Validates +40MB growth passes +50MB limit
    assert baseline_data["rss_growth_mb"] <= 50
    assert baseline_data["growth_percentage"] <= 50

def test_growth_rate_calculation():
    # Validates 5MB/min detection accuracy
    assert abs(growth_rate - 5.0) < 0.1
```

## Technical Features

### Memory Leak Detection Algorithm
- **Linear Regression**: Calculates MB/min growth rate from recent samples
- **Threshold-based**: >5MB/min growth triggers leak detection
- **Time Prediction**: Estimates time until threshold breach
- **Severity Classification**: normal/warning/critical with recommendations

### Auto-restart Protection
- **Rate Limiting**: Minimum 5-minute intervals between restarts
- **Hard Thresholds**: RSS >700MB or cache >2.2k entries trigger restart
- **Predictive Restart**: Triggers when leak will breach threshold in <5 minutes
- **Graceful Shutdown**: SIGTERM with final state logging

### Load Testing Integration
- **Baseline Establishment**: Automatic memory profiling from first 10 requests
- **Growth Tracking**: Continuous monitoring against established baseline
- **Acceptance Validation**: Built-in WAL-609 compliance checking
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response time tracking with P95 calculations
