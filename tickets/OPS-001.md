# OPS-001: Hard branch-freeze rule

**Priority**: P2  
**Owner**: DevOps  
**Created**: 2025-01-02  
**Blocks**: Development discipline  

## Goal
Implement GitHub branch protection and documentation to prevent scope creep on main branch while TRD-001 trades endpoint remains stable for GPT integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `BRANCH_FREEZE.md` file merged to main branch documenting freeze policy
- [ ] GitHub branch protection rule requiring code owner review for main
- [ ] PR template updated to require ticket ID reference in title
- [ ] Exception process documented for critical hotfixes
- [ ] Team agreement on freeze scope and duration
- [ ] Automated check for ticket ID in PR titles (GitHub Actions)

## Out of Scope
- Complete CI/CD pipeline overhaul
- Advanced GitHub workflows beyond basic protection
- Release branch strategy (keep main-based for now)
- Deployment automation changes

## Testing
- [ ] Test PR creation requires review from code owner
- [ ] Test PR without ticket ID is flagged by automation
- [ ] Test exception process with mock critical fix
- [ ] Verify freeze documentation is clear and actionable

## Implementation Notes
- Create `BRANCH_FREEZE.md` with clear policy and exceptions
- Configure GitHub branch protection: require reviews, dismiss stale reviews
- Add PR template to `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Simple GitHub Action to validate PR title format: `TICKET-###: description`
- Document unfreezing process for post-GPT-integration

## Definition of Done
Main branch is protected with documented freeze policy, requiring code owner review and ticket references, with clear exception process for emergencies.
