# CCH-001: Add Redis warm-cache

**Priority**: P3  
**Owner**: TBD  
**Created**: 2025-01-02  
**Depends**: POS-001, PRC-001  
**Blocks**: v0.9.x  

## Goal
Implement Redis-based caching for portfolio data to achieve sub-second response times for frequently accessed wallets and improve overall system performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cache warm response time <0.5 seconds for test wallet
- [ ] Cache hit ratio metric exposed in `/diagnostics` endpoint
- [ ] Cache miss fallback maintains current performance (<8s)
- [ ] Cache TTL configurable via `POSITION_CACHE_TTL_SEC` environment variable
- [ ] Cache invalidation on new wallet activity (optional: webhook-based)
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring for cache size

## Out of Scope
- Cache warming strategies (manual warm-cache endpoint already exists)
- Distributed caching across multiple workers
- Cache compression or serialization optimization
- Real-time cache invalidation via blockchain monitoring

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for cache hit/miss scenarios
- [ ] Integration test: cache miss â†’ cache hit sequence
- [ ] Performance validation: 100 cached requests <0.5s average
- [ ] Memory leak testing with cache expiration
- [ ] Redis connectivity failure graceful degradation

## Implementation Notes
- Extend existing `get_position_cache_v2()` functionality
- Ensure cache keys include wallet address and relevant cache-busting factors
- Add cache metrics to diagnostics endpoint for monitoring
- Graceful fallback when Redis is unavailable
- Consider cache warming background jobs for popular wallets

## Definition of Done
Redis caching reduces warm response times to <0.5s with hit ratio metrics available for monitoring, while maintaining graceful degradation when cache is unavailable.
