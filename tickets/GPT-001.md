# GPT-001: Public Postman / cURL cookbook

**Priority**: P1  
**Owner**: TBD  
**Created**: 2025-01-02  
**Parent**: GPT-000  

## Goal
Create copy-paste API examples that GPT team can use immediately to test the trades export endpoint with real wallets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `docs/gpt_examples.md` created with 3 complete examples
- [ ] Small wallet example (1-10 trades) returns HTTP 200
- [ ] Medium wallet example (100-500 trades) returns HTTP 200  
- [ ] Large wallet example (1000+ trades) returns HTTP 200
- [ ] Each example includes full cURL command with headers
- [ ] Each example shows expected response structure
- [ ] GPT team gives thumbs-up confirmation in Slack

## Out of Scope
- Postman collection file (just markdown examples)
- Error handling examples (focus on happy path)
- Performance optimization tips
- Authentication setup instructions (link to main docs)

## Testing
- [ ] All cURL commands tested against production endpoint
- [ ] Response times documented for each wallet size
- [ ] JSON responses validated for structure
- [ ] Examples work with both cURL and Postman

## Implementation Notes
Example structure:
```markdown
### Small Wallet (5 trades)
**Wallet**: `ABC123...`
**Expected**: ~5 trades, ~10 signatures

```bash
curl -X GET "https://web-production-2bb2f.up.railway.app/v4/trades/export-gpt/ABC123..." \
  -H "X-Api-Key: wd_12345678901234567890123456789012" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

**Response** (~500ms):
```json
{
  "wallet": "ABC123...",
  "signatures": [...],
  "trades": [...]
}
```
```

## Definition of Done
Three working examples documented in `docs/gpt_examples.md` covering different wallet sizes, with GPT team confirmation that examples work for their integration.
