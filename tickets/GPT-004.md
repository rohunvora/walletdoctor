# GPT-004: Prompt templates & few-shot examples

**Priority**: P2  
**Owner**: TBD  
**Created**: 2025-01-02  
**Parent**: GPT-000  

## Goal
Create curated prompt templates with few-shot examples that demonstrate effective trading insight queries, enabling GPT team to optimize their integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `prompts/base_trades.md` contains at least 5 Q&A examples
- [ ] Examples cover diverse use cases (PnL, patterns, risk analysis)
- [ ] Each example includes actual API response data
- [ ] Templates show how to handle large trade arrays
- [ ] GPT PM reviews and approves examples
- [ ] Examples demonstrate insight extraction techniques

## Out of Scope
- Prompt engineering for specific GPT model versions
- Non-trading related prompts
- Complex multi-step reasoning chains
- Position-based analysis (trades only for now)

## Testing
- [ ] Each example tested with actual GPT/Claude
- [ ] Response quality validated by domain expert
- [ ] Examples work with truncated trade lists
- [ ] Templates handle edge cases gracefully

## Implementation Notes
Example template structure:
```markdown
## Example 1: Recent Trading Performance

**User Query**: "What's my trading performance over the last 30 days?"

**API Data** (truncated):
```json
{
  "wallet": "34zYD...",
  "trades": [
    {"timestamp": "2025-12-15T10:30:00", "action": "buy", "token": "BONK", "amount": "1000000", "value_usd": "25.50"},
    {"timestamp": "2025-12-20T14:15:00", "action": "sell", "token": "BONK", "amount": "1000000", "value_usd": "31.25"}
  ]
}
```

**Suggested Response**:
"Looking at your last 30 days of trading:
- Total trades: 47
- Most traded token: BONK (12 trades)
- Net profit: +$234.50 (+18.3%)
- Best trade: BONK +22.5% in 5 days
- Win rate: 62% (29 profitable trades)"
```

Categories to cover:
1. Performance summary
2. Risk assessment  
3. Trading pattern analysis
4. Token concentration
5. Timing analysis

## Definition of Done
Comprehensive prompt template document with 5+ examples reviewed by GPT PM, demonstrating effective ways to extract trading insights from the trades export endpoint.
