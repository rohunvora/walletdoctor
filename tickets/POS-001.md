# POS-001: Fix position-builder filter bug

**Priority**: P1  
**Owner**: TBD  
**Created**: 2025-01-02  
**Blocks**: v0.7.1-pos-alpha  

## Goal
Fix the position builder pipeline that is returning empty positions despite having valid trades, enabling portfolio responses for wallets with trading history.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Position builder correctly processes 1091 trades into positions for test wallet
- [ ] Test wallet `34zYDgjy8oinZ5y8gyrcQktzUmSfFLJztTSq5xLUVCya` returns ≥1 open positions
- [ ] Debug logs identify exact point where positions are filtered out
- [ ] `/v4/positions/export-gpt/{wallet}` returns non-empty positions array
- [ ] Position smoke test passes for test wallet

## Out of Scope
- Pricing accuracy improvements (handled in PRC-001)
- Performance optimization beyond basic functionality
- Position builder algorithm changes (FIFO/LIFO)
- Large wallet support (handled in PAG-001)

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for position builder with known trade sequences
- [ ] Integration test with test wallet showing positions
- [ ] Debug logging validates each pipeline stage
- [ ] Smoke test updated to validate position count >0

## Implementation Notes
**Evidence from TRD-001 debug session:**
- ✅ Signatures fetched: 1713 (working)
- ✅ Trades extracted: 1091 (working)  
- ❌ Positions after filter: 0 (broken)

**Debug approach:**
1. Add `[POS-DEBUG]` logs to `PositionBuilder.build_positions_from_trades()`
2. Add logs to `PositionSnapshot.from_positions()` filtering
3. Identify filtering criteria removing all positions

## Definition of Done
Test wallet returns at least one open position with working position builder pipeline and comprehensive debug logging.
