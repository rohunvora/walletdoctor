# POS-003: Fix Positions Accuracy and Filtering

## Status: TODO (Deferred)

### Context
Positions endpoint has critical accuracy issues discovered during GPT integration testing:
- Missing real positions (e.g., RASMR token with 42→80 SOL value)
- Only showing dust positions (tiny SOL + USDC)
- Cost basis always showing 0
- P&L incorrectly showing +100% on everything

### Current State
- POSITIONS_ENABLED=false (disabled in production)
- UNREALIZED_PNL_ENABLED=false (disabled in production)
- Endpoint marked as beta/experimental in documentation
- Focus shifted to trades-based insights for immediate GPT value

### Root Cause Analysis Needed
1. **Why are positions filtered out?**
   - Check position filtering logic
   - Investigate RASMR token (B1oEzGes...) specifically
   - Review balance thresholds and token filtering

2. **Why is cost basis always 0?**
   - Trade aggregation issues
   - Cost basis calculation bugs
   - Missing transaction history

3. **Performance implications**
   - Current approach may be too complex
   - Consider simpler position tracking

### Test Case
Wallet: `3JoVBiQEA2QKsq7TzW5ez5jVRtbbYgTNijoZzp5qgkr2`
- Should show RASMR position (B1oEzGes...)
- Should calculate correct cost basis from trades
- Should show realistic P&L percentages

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All non-dust positions appear in response
- [ ] Cost basis calculated correctly from trade history
- [ ] P&L percentages are realistic (not always 100%)
- [ ] Response time < 5s for typical wallets
- [ ] 95%+ accuracy compared to Solscan/Explorer

### Alternative Approach to Consider
Instead of complex position tracking, consider:
1. Current token balances from RPC
2. Simple cost basis from last N trades
3. Skip historical position tracking
4. Focus on current portfolio snapshot

### Dependencies
- Stable trades endpoint (complete ✅)
- Token pricing (PRC-002 complete ✅)
- Better test coverage for edge cases

### Notes
- Deferred in favor of trades-based insights
- Revisit after GPT prompt templates ship
- Consider partnering with existing portfolio trackers instead of building from scratch
