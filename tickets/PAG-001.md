# PAG-001: Large-wallet pagination

**Priority**: P3  
**Owner**: TBD  
**Created**: 2025-01-02  
**Depends**: POS-001, PRC-001  
**Blocks**: Production scaling  

## Goal
Enable successful processing of large wallets (250k+ signatures) by implementing pagination and streaming responses to prevent timeouts and memory issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Wallets with 250k+ signatures complete successfully in â‰¤30 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during large wallet processing
- [ ] Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming for real-time progress updates
- [ ] Pagination parameters: `?limit=1000&offset=0` for signature fetching
- [ ] Graceful handling of Helius rate limits during large fetches
- [ ] Progress tracking: `{"processed": 5000, "total": 250000, "estimated_remaining": "45s"}`

## Out of Scope
- Complete signature history (focus on recent 6 months max)
- Real-time streaming of individual trades during processing
- Background job processing (keep synchronous for now)
- Database persistence of large wallet state

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for pagination logic
- [ ] Integration test with simulated 250k signature wallet
- [ ] Performance validation: memory usage <2GB during processing
- [ ] SSE client test receiving progress updates
- [ ] Rate limit handling test with simulated Helius throttling

## Implementation Notes
- Extend existing SSE endpoint `/v4/positions/export-gpt-stream/{wallet}`
- Add pagination to `BlockchainFetcherV3Fast._fetch_signature_page()`
- Implement signature count estimation before full fetch
- Add progress tracking to existing `ProgressTracker`
- Consider signature date filtering to limit scope

## Definition of Done
Large wallets (250k+ signatures) process successfully within 30 seconds using pagination and SSE progress updates, with stable memory usage throughout.
