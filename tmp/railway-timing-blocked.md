# Railway Timing Test - Blocked

## Issue
Cannot run timing tests on Railway deployment - API endpoints are not responding correctly.

## Test Results
- App responds to root URL: 200 OK
- `/v3/wallets/.../trades` endpoint: 404 Not Found  
- `/v4/positions/export-gpt/...` endpoint: 60s timeout

## Wallet Address
Corrected wallet address with actual trading data:
- `34zYDgjy8oinZ5y8gyrcQktzUmSfFLJztTSq5xLUVCya` (145 trades)

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables need to be set in Railway:

```
HELIUS_KEY=<real key>
BIRDEYE_API_KEY=<real key>
POSITIONS_ENABLED=true
UNREALIZED_PNL_ENABLED=true
WEB_CONCURRENCY=2
GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=--timeout 120 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker
HELIUS_PARALLEL_REQUESTS=5
HELIUS_MAX_RETRIES=2
HELIUS_TIMEOUT=15
POSITION_CACHE_TTL=300
ENABLE_CACHE_WARMING=true
```

## Next Steps
1. Verify Railway deployment has the latest code from main branch
2. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
3. Check Railway logs for startup errors
4. Re-run timing tests once deployment is confirmed working
