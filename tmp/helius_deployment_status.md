# Helius-Only Pricing Deployment Status

**Time**: 2025-07-02 03:25 EDT

## Environment Check ❌

```bash
# Current environment (from diagnostics):
POSITION_CACHE_TTL: 300  # ❌ Should be POSITION_CACHE_TTL_SEC
PRICE_HELIUS_ONLY: (not set)  # ❌ Should be "true"
```

## Service Status

1. **Diagnostics Endpoint**: ✅ Responding (HTTP 200)
2. **GPT Export Endpoint**: ❌ Internal Server Error (even with beta_mode)

## Performance Test Results

Without `PRICE_HELIUS_ONLY=true`:
- Cold request: **Timeout** after 30s (target <8s)
- Warm request: **Timeout** after 5s (target <0.5s)

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Environment Variables** were added in Railway:
   ```
   POSITION_CACHE_TTL_SEC=300
   PRICE_HELIUS_ONLY=true
   ```

2. **Check deployment status** - the environment changes may need a redeploy

3. **Debug the internal error** - even beta_mode is failing, suggesting a deeper issue

## Expected After Proper Deployment

With `PRICE_HELIUS_ONLY=true`:
- Birdeye API will NOT be called
- Prices extracted from Helius swap data
- Performance: <8s cold, <0.5s warm
