# Railway Performance Analysis - Critical Timeout Issue

## üö® Current Issue
- Cold cache request times out at 45+ seconds
- No response headers received
- Request reaches Railway but app doesn't respond

## üîç Likely Causes

1. **Helius API Bottleneck**
   - Current: `HELIUS_PARALLEL_REQUESTS=5`
   - May be too low for 145 trades

2. **Sync Workers + Async Code**
   - We removed UvicornWorker but still using `asyncio.run()` in threads
   - This can cause deadlocks with sync workers

3. **Memory/Resource Constraints**
   - App might be hitting Railway's memory limits

## üöÄ Immediate Optimizations

### 1. Increase Helius Parallelism
```
HELIUS_PARALLEL_REQUESTS=10
HELIUS_TIMEOUT=30
```

### 2. Add Request Logging
Set in Railway:
```
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

### 3. Check Railway Logs
Look for:
- Memory usage spikes
- Helius API errors
- Python exceptions

### 4. Test Smaller Batch
Try a wallet with fewer trades first:
```bash
# Test wallet with ~10 trades
curl -H "X-Api-Key: wd_12345678901234567890123456789012" \
  https://web-production-2bb2f.up.railway.app/v4/positions/export-gpt/test_wallet_address
```

## üìä Performance Breakdown Needed

We need to see where the 45+ seconds are spent:
- Helius signature fetch
- Transaction batch fetch  
- Price lookups
- Position calculations

## üõ†Ô∏è Potential Code Fix

The `run_async()` function might be causing issues. Consider:
1. Using a proper async framework (FastAPI)
2. Or removing async entirely for Flask
3. Or using Celery for background processing
