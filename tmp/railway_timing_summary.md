# Railway Timing Results - Small Wallet (145 trades)

**Date**: 2025-07-02 01:09:33  
**Wallet**: 34zYDgjy8oinZ5y8gyrcQktzUmSfFLJztTSq5xLUVCya  

## Results
- **Cold cache**: 502 error @ 5.14s  
- **Warm cache**: 502 error @ 5.13s  

All requests failed with Railway 502 "Application failed to respond" after ~5 seconds. This indicates Railway's proxy is timing out before the app can respond.

## Root Cause
The application is taking >5s to process the request, hitting Railway's internal proxy timeout.

## Optimization Suggestions

### 1. Quick Fix: Increase Railway Proxy Timeout
Add to Railway environment:
```
RAILWAY_PROXY_TIMEOUT=30
```

### 2. Medium-term: Optimize Helius Fetching
Since the app times out before sending any phase timing headers, the bottleneck is likely in the initial Helius fetch phase.

**Specific optimizations**:
- Increase `HELIUS_PARALLEL_REQUESTS` from 5 to 10
- Implement request batching for Helius API calls  
- Add early-exit for wallets with >100 trades (return partial data)

### 3. Alternative: Switch to Background Processing
- Return immediately with a job ID
- Process in background and cache results
- Client polls for completion

## Next Steps
1. Set Railway proxy timeout to 30s
2. Redeploy and re-test
3. If still >30s, implement Helius batching
