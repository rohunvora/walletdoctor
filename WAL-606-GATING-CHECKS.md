# WAL-606 Gating Checks

## Overview
Completed two gating checks before enabling `UNREALIZED_PNL_ENABLED=true` in production.

## 1. Fresh Wallet Sanity Check

### Real Wallet Analysis

4. **LABUBU**: 24,992.65 tokens, cost basis $0.0299/token

### P&L Summary
- Total bought: $13,859.80
- Total sold: $8,486.01
- Net spent: $5,373.80
- Open position cost basis: $2,270.26

### Cross-Check Example (USDC)
```
USDC trades:
  Trade 1: sell 228.71336 @ $1.0376 = $237.31
  Trade 2: buy 701.824877 @ $1.0673 = $749.08
  Trade 3: sell 385.57978 @ $1.0575 = $407.74
  Trade 4: buy 282.003398 @ $1.0625 = $299.63
  Trade 5: sell 207.197844 @ $1.0605 = $219.73
  Trade 6: buy 282.971316 @ $1.0589 = $299.63
  Trade 7: sell 11.206871 @ $1.0250 = $11.49

USDC summary:
  - Net amount: 434.101736 USDC
  - Total buy volume: $1348.34
  - Total sell volume: $876.26
  - Net position: $472.08
```

## 2. Redis Failover Drill

### Test Setup
```python
# Force invalid Redis URL
os.environ["REDIS_URL"] = "redis://invalid-host:6379"
```

### Results
```
=== Redis Failover Test ===
Starting with invalid Redis URL...
WARNING: Redis connection failed: Error 8 connecting to invalid-host:6379. Name or service not known.
WARNING: Falling back to in-memory cache
Cache type: in-memory

API Response:
✓ Status: 200 OK
✓ Positions included: 3 positions
✓ Position summary present
✓ Unrealized P&L calculated

Performance:
- First request: 3.72s (includes fallback)
- Second request: 0.15s (using in-memory cache)
```

### Key Observations
1. System gracefully handled Redis failure
2. Automatic fallback to in-memory cache
3. No API errors or failures
4. Performance acceptable with in-memory cache
5. LRU eviction policy prevents memory bloat

## 3. Production Readiness

### Feature Flags (All Disabled by Default)
```python
POSITIONS_ENABLED = False  # Master switch
UNREALIZED_PNL_ENABLED = False  # Unrealized P&L calculations
ENHANCED_TRADE_DATA = False  # Additional trade fields
COST_BASIS_METHOD = "weighted_avg"  # Default method
```

### Cache Configuration
- Redis primary: 5min TTL for positions
- In-memory fallback: 1000 item LRU cache
- Pattern-based invalidation on new trades

### API Changes
- `/v4/analyze`: Enhanced with positions array
- `/v4/positions/{wallet}`: New dedicated endpoint
- Full backward compatibility maintained

## Recommendations

1. **Enable in production** with flags still disabled
2. **Beta test** with select wallets by enabling flags
3. **Monitor** Redis connection stability and cache hit rates
4. **Scale Redis** if cache misses exceed 20%

## Next Steps
- Merge to main with flags disabled
- Enable for beta cohort via environment variables
- Wire WAL-598 nightly GPT validation
- Update API documentation/Swagger

## Sign-off
- [x] Real wallet data verified (no mock tokens)
- [x] Cost basis calculations appear correct
- [x] Redis failover tested and working
- [x] Performance acceptable in both modes
- [x] Ready for production deployment
