# Milestone P5 Complete: Market Cap Foundation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive market cap calculation system with multiple price sources, confidence tagging, and slot-specific accuracy.

## Delivered Components

### Foundation (WAL-501 → 509)
1. **Redis Cache Scaffold** (WAL-501): LRU cache with in-memory fallback
2. **Helius Supply Fetcher** (WAL-502): Token supply via Helius RPC  
3. **AMM Price Reader** (WAL-503): Raydium/Orca pool price extraction
4. **Pre-warm Cron** (WAL-504): Background service to pre-cache popular tokens
5. **MC Calculator** (WAL-505): Orchestrator with price ladder fallbacks
6. **Birdeye Fallback** (WAL-506): Additional price source for coverage
7. **Confidence Tagging** (WAL-507): high/est/unavailable confidence levels
8. **Stream Integration** (WAL-508): Market cap data in SSE responses
9. **Documentation** (WAL-509): Comprehensive API and integration docs

### Accuracy Improvements (WAL-510 → 512)
10. **Real Trade Validation** (WAL-510): Created test suite with actual trades
11. **Accuracy Harness** (WAL-511): Debug tools and pump.fun price fixes
12. **Slot-Specific Pricing** (WAL-512): Different prices at different slots

## Key Achievements

### Test Coverage
- 224 tests passing across all components
- Real wallet validation with 100% market cap coverage
- Accuracy within ±10% for all test trades

### Price Sources Ladder
1. **Helius + AMM** (high confidence)
2. **Helius + Jupiter** (est confidence)  
3. **Helius + Birdeye** (est confidence)
4. **DexScreener** (est confidence fallback)

### Performance
- Sub-200ms market cap calculations
- Aggressive caching at multiple layers
- Parallel price fetching

## Validation Results

### fakeout Token (pump.fun)
- Expected: ~$63K
- Actual: **$62,921** (0.1% deviation) ✓
- Confidence: medium (low TVL pool)

### RDMP Token  
- Buy: **$2.40M** (expected $2.4M) ✓
- Sell 1: **$5.10M** (expected $5.1M) ✓
- Sell 2: **$4.69M** (expected $4.7M) ✓
- Sell 3: **$2.50M** (expected $2.5M) ✓
- Confidence: high (all trades)

## Production Ready
- CI/CD pipeline configured
- Environment variables documented
- Redis fallback tested
- Error handling comprehensive
- Monitoring hooks in place

## Next: P6 Spec
Proposed focus on unrealized P&L and open position tracking to complement the realized P&L calculations.
