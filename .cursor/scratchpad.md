# Pocket Trading Coach - Current State & Strategy

## 🎯 Project Vision
A Telegram bot that acts as a real-time trading coach by:
1. Monitoring user trades as they happen
2. Asking context-aware questions based on patterns
3. Remembering conversations to build understanding
4. Helping traders recognize their own behavioral patterns

## 📊 Current Implementation Status

### What's Built and Working:
1. **Real-time Trade Monitoring** ✅
   - Detects trades within 5 seconds via `telegram_bot_coach.py`
   - Monitors user wallets with personalized tracking
   - Integrates with Pump.fun, Raydium, and other DEXes

2. **Pattern Detection** ✅
   - Repeat token tracking (warns on repeated failures)
   - Position size analysis (alerts on oversized trades)
   - Hold time patterns (identifies optimal exit windows)
   - Immediate patterns (dust trades, round numbers, late night)

3. **State-Based Memory** ✅
   - Token notebooks track conversation state per token
   - Open questions queue prevents duplicate questions
   - Persistent storage survives bot restarts
   - Per-user isolation for privacy

4. **P&L-Aware Responses** ✅
   - Integrated Cielo Finance for accurate P&L
   - Different templates for profits vs losses
   - Context-aware questions based on position performance

### Current Problems:
1. **Bot Still Feels Dumb** - Rigid rules can't understand context
2. **Wrong Classifications** - "Cut the position" while UP gets tagged as "stop loss"
3. **P&L Accuracy Issues** - Sometimes shows incorrect profit numbers
4. **Pointless Callbacks** - Quotes user from "0 minutes ago"

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
User Wallet → Real-time Monitor → Pattern Service → State Manager → Nudge Engine → Telegram
                    ↓                                    ↓
              DuckDB Storage                    Token Notebooks
```

### Key Components:
- `telegram_bot_coach.py` - Main bot with commands and monitoring
- `state_manager.py` - Conversation state and memory management
- `pattern_service.py` - Detects trading patterns and behaviors
- `nudge_engine.py` - Generates contextual questions/nudges
- `scripts/pnl_service.py` - P&L data from Cielo/Birdeye

## 🚀 Next Step: Context-Aware AI Layer

### The Problem:
Each bug fix adds more if/else complexity without solving the core issue - the bot doesn't actually understand what's happening, it just follows rules.

### Proposed Solution:
Build a context-aware AI layer that:
1. **Understands Intent** - "Cut the position" means different things when up vs down
2. **Tracks Conversation Flow** - Knows what was discussed and when
3. **Generates Natural Responses** - Not just template selection
4. **Learns User Patterns** - Adapts to individual trading styles

### Implementation Approach:
1. **Context Packs** - Bundle trade data, conversation history, and user patterns
2. **LLM Integration** - Use GPT-4 for understanding, not just templates
3. **Thin Slice First** - Start with classification (stop loss vs profit taking)
4. **Gradual Expansion** - Add more intelligence incrementally

## 📁 Repository Structure

### Core Bot Files:
- `telegram_bot_coach.py` - Production bot with state management
- `state_manager.py` - Conversation state and memory
- `pattern_service.py` - Pattern detection logic
- `nudge_engine.py` - Question/nudge generation
- `conversation_manager.py` - User interaction handling

### Supporting Services:
- `scripts/pnl_service.py` - P&L data integration
- `scripts/personal_history.py` - User trading history
- `scripts/token_metadata.py` - Token information
- `scripts/price_service.py` - Price data and caching

### Web Interface (Separate Product):
- `web/web_app_v2.py` - Web-based wallet analysis
- `telegram_bot_simple.py` - Original simple bot (deprecated?)

### Documentation:
- `README.md` - User-facing documentation
- `.cursor/scratchpad.md` - This file, internal state tracking
- Various docs in `docs/` - Historical implementation notes

## 🎯 Strategic Direction

### Immediate Priority:
Before adding AI complexity, we need to:
1. **Clean up the repository** - Remove deprecated files ✅
2. **Consolidate documentation** - Single source of truth ✅
3. **Fix known bugs** - P&L accuracy, classification issues
4. **Establish clear architecture** - What each component does ✅

### Then Build Context Layer:
1. **Start Small** - Just improve stop loss vs profit taking classification
2. **Use Existing Data** - Context packs from current state manager
3. **Test Thoroughly** - Ensure it actually improves user experience
4. **Iterate Based on Feedback** - Let users guide development

### Success Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Correct classification of user intent
- **Relevance**: Questions that make sense in context
- **Engagement**: Users actually answer the questions
- **Behavior Change**: Measurable improvement in trading

## 🚫 What We're NOT Building
- Whale tracking systems
- Copy trading features
- Price predictions
- Market analysis
- Generic trading advice
- Web dashboards (until bot is perfect)

## 📝 Technical Debt to Address
1. Multiple database files (consolidate to one) ✅
2. Two telegram bots (deprecate simple version?) ❌ (Both serve different purposes)
3. Scattered documentation (consolidate to README + this file) ✅
4. Test coverage (many tests but unclear what's tested)
5. Error handling (some edge cases not covered)

## 🔄 Next Actions
1. Clean up repository structure ✅
2. Update README with accurate current state ✅
3. Document the context-aware AI approach ✅
4. Create implementation plan for AI layer ✅
5. Begin with thin slice: intent classification

## 📋 Executor's Update: Repository Cleanup Complete

### ✅ Completed Actions:

1. **Repository Structure Reorganized**
   - Created `web/` directory for web interface files
   - Created `management/` directory for bot scripts
   - Created `docs/archive/` for historical documentation
   - Moved all files to appropriate locations

2. **Database Cleanup**
   - Kept `pocket_coach.db` as production database
   - Backed up and removed `coach.db` and `wallet_coach.db`
   - Confirmed `telegram_bot_simple.py` uses temporary databases

3. **Documentation Updated**
   - README now clearly distinguishes two products
   - PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md reflects new organization
   - BOT_MANAGEMENT.md updated with new script paths
   - Created CONTEXT_AWARE_AI_PLAN.md for next phase
   - Created REPOSITORY_CLEANUP_PLAN.md for reference

4. **Path References Fixed**
   - Updated Procfile for web deployment
   - Fixed all script paths in documentation
   - Ensured all imports will work correctly

### 📊 Current Clean Structure:
```
Root: Bot files + core components
├── scripts/: Shared utilities
├── web/: Web interface
├── management/: Bot scripts
├── docs/: Active documentation
│   └── archive/: Historical docs
└── tests/: Test suite
```

### 🎯 Ready for Next Phase:
The repository is now clean and organized. We can proceed with:
1. Fixing known bugs (P&L accuracy, classification)
2. Implementing the context-aware AI layer

The ground truth is established and the path forward is clear.
