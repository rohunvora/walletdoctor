# WAL-613 Railway Debugging Summary

## ‚úÖ Confirmed: HELIUS_KEY IS Present
Your screenshots confirm HELIUS_KEY is set in Railway, so the issue is NOT missing environment variables.

## üîç Debugging Tools Added

### 1. Enhanced Startup Logging
```python
# Added immediate logging on startup
logger.info("WalletDoctor GPT API Starting...")
logger.info(f"HELIUS_KEY present: {bool(os.getenv('HELIUS_KEY'))}")
```

### 2. Fixed Response Mode
Set `DEBUG_FIXED_RESPONSE=true` in Railway to bypass all async code:
```bash
curl -H "X-Api-Key: wd_12345678901234567890123456789012" \
  https://web-production-2bb2f.up.railway.app/v4/positions/export-gpt/test
```

### 3. Asyncio Fix
Updated `run_async()` to handle UvicornWorker's event loop properly.

### 4. Alternative Procfile
Created `Procfile.sync` without UvicornWorker in case that's the issue.

### 5. Minimal Test App
Created `src/api/minimal_test_app.py` to isolate framework issues.

## üìã Next Steps for Railway Admin

1. **Add these environment variables:**
   ```
   LOG_LEVEL=debug
   DEBUG_FIXED_RESPONSE=true
   PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
   ```

2. **Redeploy and check logs for:**
   - "WalletDoctor GPT API Starting..." message
   - Any stack traces
   - Import errors

3. **Test fixed response:**
   ```bash
   curl -H "X-Api-Key: wd_12345678901234567890123456789012" \
     https://web-production-2bb2f.up.railway.app/v4/positions/export-gpt/test
   ```

4. **If still 502, try sync workers:**
   - Rename `Procfile.sync` to `Procfile`
   - Remove `--worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker` from GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS

## üéØ Most Likely Causes

1. **Asyncio/UvicornWorker Conflict** - Our Flask app uses `asyncio.run()` which conflicts with UvicornWorker
2. **Import-time Exception** - Something else failing during import (we'll see in logs)
3. **Memory Limit** - App exceeds Railway's memory during startup
4. **Network Egress** - Railway blocking calls to Helius/Birdeye

## üìÅ Files Added/Modified

- `src/api/wallet_analytics_api_v4_gpt.py` - Enhanced logging, fixed asyncio, debug mode
- `Procfile.sync` - Alternative without UvicornWorker
- `src/api/minimal_test_app.py` - Minimal test to isolate issues
- `test_local_railway_env.sh` - Test locally with Railway's exact env
- `tmp/railway_debug_steps.md` - Detailed debugging guide

## Local Testing
To reproduce locally:
```bash
./test_local_railway_env.sh
# In another terminal:
curl http://localhost:8080/v4/diagnostics
```

Once we see the Railway logs with LOG_LEVEL=debug, we'll know exactly what's failing!
