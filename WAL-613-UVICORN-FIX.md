# WAL-613 Uvicorn Issue - SOLVED! 🎉

## 🐛 The Problem
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uvicorn'
```

Railway couldn't start the app because:
1. Procfile specified `--worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`
2. But `uvicorn` is NOT in requirements.txt
3. Result: 502 errors on every request

## 🔍 Analysis of Possible Sources

### Considered:
1. **Missing uvicorn dependency** ✅ CONFIRMED
2. **Wrong worker class for Flask** ✅ CONFIRMED
3. Package installation failure
4. Python version mismatch
5. Virtual environment issues
6. Railway-specific limitations
7. Procfile syntax issues

### Root Causes:
1. **uvicorn not installed** - It's not in requirements.txt
2. **Wrong worker type** - Flask is a WSGI app, not ASGI. UvicornWorker is for FastAPI/Starlette

## ✅ The Fix
Removed `--worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker` from Procfile.

Flask apps should use gunicorn's default sync workers, not async ASGI workers.

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Deploy this change** - The app should start immediately
2. **Test endpoints:**
   ```bash
   # Diagnostics
   curl https://web-production-2bb2f.up.railway.app/v4/diagnostics
   
   # GPT export
   curl -H "X-Api-Key: wd_12345678901234567890123456789012" \
     https://web-production-2bb2f.up.railway.app/v4/positions/export-gpt/34zYDgjy8oinZ5y8gyrcQktzUmSfFLJztTSq5xLUVCya
   ```

3. **Run timing tests** once the app is working

## 📝 Lessons Learned
- Always check that dependencies in Procfile are in requirements.txt
- Flask apps don't need async workers
- Railway's error logs are hidden in "Build Logs" not "Deploy Logs"

The app should work perfectly now! 🎊
