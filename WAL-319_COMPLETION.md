# WAL-319 Completion: P3 Cleanup & CI Integration

## Summary
Successfully cleaned up Milestone P3 implementation and added CI performance testing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Switched Fast Fetcher to RPC + 1000-sig Pages
- Updated `src/lib/blockchain_fetcher_v3_fast.py` to use RPC endpoint
- Uses `getSignaturesForAddress` with 1000-signature pages
- Batch fetches transactions in parallel (40 concurrent)
- Removed old test mode limitations

### 2. Removed Old Limits and References
- Removed all hardcoded `limit=100` references
- Changed 20-page warning to 120-page warning
- Removed noisy loop detection logs
- Updated all documentation

### 3. Added Performance CI Test
- Created `tests/test_perf_ci.py` with 3 tests:
  - Performance test: Ensures <20s for 5k+ trade wallet
  - RPC endpoint verification
  - No limit=100 references check
- Test runs by default with pytest
- All tests passing in ~13s

### 4. Updated Documentation
- **README.md**: Updated with RPC architecture and performance details
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Created with v3.1.0 release notes
- **docs/V3_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**: Updated deployment instructions

### 5. Performance Results
- Test wallet (6,424 trades): 13-17s (was 107s)
- API calls: ~118 (was 5,564)
- RPC pages: 16 @ 1000 sigs (was 86 @ 100)
- Transaction batches: 93 in parallel

## Verification
```bash
# Run performance test
pytest tests/test_perf_ci.py -v

# Check for old references
grep -R "limit=100" src/
# (No results)

grep -R "20.*page" src/
# (No results)

grep -R "enhanced.*transaction" src/
# (No results)
```

## CI Integration
The performance test is now part of the standard test suite and will run automatically in CI to prevent performance regressions.
