# WAL-613 Final PR Summary

## ✅ Implemented
1. **10s fail-fast timeouts** - No more 30-60s hangs
2. **Strict mode by default** - CI fails immediately on API errors  
3. **Phase timing tracking** - Identify bottlenecks when they occur
4. **No automatic mock fallback** - Must use --use-mock explicitly

## 📊 Railway Timing Results

```
Small wallet (145 trades):
- Cold cache: 502 error @ 5.14s ❌
- Warm cache: 502 error @ 5.13s ❌
```

Railway's proxy times out at ~5s before the app can respond.

## 🚀 Optimization Path

### Immediate (for Railway admin):
```bash
# Add to Railway environment
RAILWAY_PROXY_TIMEOUT=30
HELIUS_PARALLEL_REQUESTS=10  # increase from 5
```

### If still >30s after above:
1. **Batch Helius requests** - Combine multiple transaction fetches
2. **Early exit** - Return partial data for wallets >100 trades  
3. **Background processing** - Return job ID, process async

## 🧪 CI Status
- **Strict job**: Will fail with clear error (good signal)
- **Offline job**: Passes for contributors without keys

## 📁 Files Changed
- `scripts/test_railway_performance.py` - 10s timeout, phase timing
- `tests/gpt_validation/test_runner.py` - 10s timeout, no auto-mock
- `tmp/railway_timing_*.json` - Timing results with 502 errors
- `tmp/railway_timing_summary.md` - Analysis & suggestions
- `docs/BETA_VALIDATION_STATUS.md` - Updated with results

## Next Step
Railway admin needs to set proxy timeout and redeploy. Then we can see real phase timings and decide on further optimizations.
