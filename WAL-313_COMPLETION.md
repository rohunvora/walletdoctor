# WAL-313 Completion: Handle 429 with backoff

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Implementation Date**: Dec 20, 2024

## Summary
Successfully implemented batch-wide 429 error handling with exponential backoff (5/10/20s) in the parallel page fetcher.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `_fetch_single_page` in blockchain_fetcher_v3.py
- Changed return signature to include `hit_rate_limit` flag
- Removed individual page retry logic
- Pages now return immediately with rate limit flag on 429
- Returns: `(transactions, next_before_sig, is_empty, hit_rate_limit)`

### 2. Enhanced `_fetch_pages_parallel` in blockchain_fetcher_v3.py
- Added batch-wide 429 detection using `any()` on rate limit flags
- Implemented exponential backoff with delays: [5, 10, 20] seconds
- Retries entire batch up to 3 times on rate limit
- Progress messages show attempt number and wait time
- Returns results after successful fetch or max retries

## Test Results

### Test Script: test_backoff_429.py
Verified batch-wide 429 handling with large wallet (5,478 trades):

```
✓ Batch retry messages with correct backoff:
  - "Batch hit rate limit, waiting 5s before retry (attempt 1/3)..."
  - "Batch hit rate limit, waiting 10s before retry (attempt 2/3)..."
  - "Batch hit rate limit, waiting 20s before retry (attempt 3/3)..."

✓ No individual page retry messages (handled at batch level)
✓ Successful trade fetching continues after retries
```

## Performance Impact
- Batch retries are more efficient than individual page retries
- Reduces cascading 429 errors
- Allows entire batch to recover together
- Still limited by semaphore (10 concurrent requests)

## Success Criteria Met
- ✅ Detects HTTP 429 at batch level
- ✅ Pauses entire batch on 429
- ✅ Exponential backoff: 5s → 10s → 20s
- ✅ No individual page 429 retries in logs

## Helius Paid Plan Update
After implementation, user reported having Helius paid plan (50 RPS):
- Updated `HELIUS_RPS` from 10 to 50
- Updated `max_concurrent` from 10 to 40
- Updated default `parallel_pages` from 15 to 40
- Still hitting rate limits - need to verify API key status
- See `HELIUS_PAID_PLAN_UPDATE.md` for details

## Next Steps
- WAL-314: Auto-tune parallel_pages on repeated 429s
- Verify Helius API key is on paid plan
- Monitor production performance with new batch retry logic
