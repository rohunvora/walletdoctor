# Railway Deployment Checklist

## 🚀 Your deployment has been triggered!

Since your Railway is connected to GitHub, the deployment should start automatically after the push.

## ✅ Required Environment Variables in Railway

To ensure personalized AI insights work properly, configure these in your Railway project settings:

1. **HELIUS_KEY** - For blockchain data
   - Get from: https://dev.helius.xyz/

2. **CIELO_KEY** - For trading P&L data  
   - Get from: https://cielo.finance/

3. **OPENAI_API_KEY** - For personalized AI insights ⭐
   - Get from: https://platform.openai.com/
   - This is CRITICAL for personalized patterns and messages

## 📝 Setting Environment Variables in Railway

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service (web)
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add each variable:
   - Click "New Variable"
   - Enter the key name (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY)
   - Enter your API key value
   - Railway will auto-redeploy when you add variables

## 🎯 What's New

- **Personalized Insights**: The "Key Patterns Detected" and "Real Talk" sections now use AI to analyze actual wallet data
- **Specific Trade Analysis**: Mentions exact tokens, amounts, and patterns unique to each wallet
- **No More Templates**: All generic if/else logic has been replaced with data-driven AI analysis
- **Fallback Support**: If OpenAI isn't configured, still shows data-driven insights from harsh_insights

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

1. Check Railway logs for deployment status
2. Visit your app URL
3. Enter wallet: `34zYDgjy8oinZ5y8gyrcQktzUmSfFLJztTSq5xLUVCya`
4. Verify you see specific insights mentioning actual tokens and amounts

## 💡 Example of What You Should See

Instead of:
- "Your 27% win rate is rough"

You'll see:
- "Your BONK position of $12,400 was 3x larger than your average winner"
- "Holding SILLY for 47 hours cost you $19,476"
- Specific patterns from THIS wallet's data

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If insights seem generic:
1. Check Railway logs for "Generating AI insights..." 
2. Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set in Railway variables
3. Check for any error messages in logs
