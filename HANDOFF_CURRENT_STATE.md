# Pocket Trading Coach - Current State Handoff

**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Branch**: `analytics-event-store`  
**Bot Status**: Analytics fully operational, behavioral transformation in progress

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The Pocket Trading Coach has evolved from a simple trade acknowledger to an intelligent trading assistant. Two major improvements are complete:

1. **Analytics Infrastructure** (✅ Complete) - Time-based queries and accurate calculations
2. **Behavioral Transformation** (🔄 In Progress) - "Ironman suit" intelligent assistant

## 📊 Current System Architecture

```
User Message → GPT (v2 prompt) → Analytics Tools → Event Store → Python Calculations → Intelligent Response
```

### Core Components:
- **Bot**: `telegram_bot_coach.py` - Main bot with analytics integration
- **Prompt**: `coach_prompt_v2.md` - New intelligent assistant behavior 
- **Analytics**: Event store + aggregator for accurate calculations
- **Data**: Dual-write to diary + events tables

## ✅ What's Working Now

### 1. Analytics System (Phase 5 Complete)
- **Time queries**: "how am i doing today/this week/etc"
- **Accurate math**: Python calculations, not GPT approximations
- **Period comparisons**: "am i improving?" with real data
- **Goal tracking**: Progress toward user objectives

### 2. Intelligent Assistant Behavior (New)
- **Proactive analysis**: Automatically calculates position sizing
- **Pattern recognition**: Finds similar trades from history
- **Accountability**: Pushes for reasoning and exit plans
- **Context-aware**: Different response lengths for different scenarios

### 3. Infrastructure
- **Event store**: 76+ events stored, dual-write operational
- **Performance**: <10ms queries, 200ms end-to-end
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with real scenarios

## 🔧 Recent Changes

### Coach Prompt v2 (Major Behavioral Change)
- Rewritten from "brief acknowledger" to "intelligent assistant"
- Added proactive tool usage for implicit triggers
- Defined when to be brief (5-10 words) vs detailed (15-25 words)
- Real examples showing bad vs good responses

### Technical Adjustments
- Timeout: 2s → 30s (for analytics calls)
- Max tokens: 40 → 200 (prevents cutoffs)
- Added test cache to gitignore

### New Test Files
- `test_ironman_scenarios.py` - Tests 5 core use cases
- `test_analytics_cutover.py` - Validates analytics integration
- `test_natural_conversations.py` - Natural language testing
- `ANALYTICS_CUTOVER_RESULTS.md` - Phase 5 completion report

## 🚀 Quick Start (On Your Laptop)

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git checkout analytics-event-store
git pull origin analytics-event-store

# 2. Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Start the bot with new behavior
export USE_COACH_V2=true  # Uses new intelligent prompt
./management/start_bot.sh

# 4. Test intelligent responses
# Send messages like:
# - "just bought POPCAT"
# - "this is pumping hard"
# - "how am i doing today?"
```

## 📝 Key Files to Know

### Core Bot Files
- `coach_prompt_v2.md` - New intelligent assistant prompt
- `coach_prompt_v1.md` - Old brief acknowledger (still default)
- `telegram_bot_coach.py` - Main bot (uses v1 by default)
- `gpt_client.py` - Updated timeouts and token limits

### Analytics Files
- `event_store.py` - Event storage system
- `aggregator.py` - Python calculations
- `diary_api.py` - Analytics tool implementations

### Test Files
- `test_ironman_scenarios.py` - Main behavior test
- `test_bot_scenarios.py` - Regression test suite
- `TESTING_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - Test documentation

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **NoneType errors** in analytics functions (non-critical)
2. **Coach v2 not default** - Need to set USE_COACH_V2 env var
3. **Limited test data** - Need active trading for full validation

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Make v2 prompt default** after testing confirms it works well
2. **Fix NoneType errors** in diary_api analytics functions
3. **Test with real trades** to validate pattern recognition

### Short Term
1. **Monitor user reactions** to intelligent responses
2. **Fine-tune response triggers** based on usage
3. **Add more sophisticated patterns** as we learn what works

### Long Term
1. **Pre-computed aggregates** for faster historical queries
2. **Advanced analytics** (risk metrics, win streaks, etc)
3. **Personalized learning** from user feedback

## 💡 Development Tips

### Testing the New Behavior
```python
# Run ironman scenarios test
python test_ironman_scenarios.py

# Test single scenario
python test_single_scenario.py

# Test analytics
python test_analytics_live.py
```

### Switching Between Prompts
```python
# In telegram_bot_coach.py, around line 1200
# Currently loads coach_prompt_v1.md
# Can change to coach_prompt_v2.md or use env var
```

### Adding New Patterns
1. Update examples in `coach_prompt_v2.md`
2. Add test case in `test_ironman_scenarios.py`
3. Test with real wallet data

## 📊 Success Metrics

The bot should now:
1. **Calculate automatically** - Position sizing without being asked
2. **Find patterns** - "Similar to your BONK trade that went 3x"
3. **Push accountability** - "What's your exit plan?"
4. **Stay conversational** - Not write reports

## 🔑 Critical Context

The transformation from v1 to v2 is about **philosophy**:
- v1: "Acknowledge trades, be brief"
- v2: "Be genuinely helpful, add intelligence"

This changes everything about how the bot responds. It's not just longer responses - it's proactive analysis and pattern recognition.
