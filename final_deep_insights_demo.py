OVERALL DIAGNOSIS
================================================================================
üîç Primary Issue: Emotional gambler disguised as trader
üß† Root Problem: You're using the market to process emotions, not make money
‚ö†Ô∏è  Severity: CRITICAL
üìä Patterns Active: 3

üîÆ PROGNOSIS: You're profitable despite yourself. When luck runs out, these 
patterns will destroy you.

üíä PRESCRIPTION:
   1. IMMEDIATE: Max position size = 2% of portfolio. Break this = stop trading for 1 week.
   2. RULE: -5% stop loss on EVERY trade. Set it when you enter. No exceptions.
   3. DOCUMENT: Before ANY trade, write: Entry reason, exit plan, position size.

üìà Analysis Confidence: High confidence - patterns are statistically validated

================================================================================
üéØ You hold losers 27% longer than winners
   Confidence: 87% | Severity: HIGH

üìä ROOT CAUSE: Ego protection and fear of being wrong
üí≠ YOUR INNER VOICE: "If I don't sell, it's not a real loss. It might come back."
üîÑ THE LOOP: Small loss ‚Üí Denial ‚Üí Bigger loss ‚Üí Desperation ‚Üí Hold forever

üìà EVIDENCE:
   ‚Ä¢ Winners held: 293 min avg
   ‚Ä¢ Losers held: 373 min avg
   ‚Ä¢ Extra hold on losers: 80 min
   ‚Ä¢ Statistical significance: p=0.002
   ‚Ä¢ Effect size (Cohen's d): 0.68

‚ö° HARSH TRUTH:
   You're not 'being patient'‚Äîyou're in denial. Every minute past -5% is ego, 
   not strategy.

‚úÖ THE FIX:
   Hard stop loss at -5%. No exceptions. Set it when you enter.

================================================================================
üéØ After losses, you 10x your position size
   Confidence: 92% | Severity: CRITICAL

üìä ROOT CAUSE: Need to "get even" with the market
üí≠ YOUR INNER VOICE: "I'll make it all back on this next trade."
üîÑ THE LOOP: Loss ‚Üí Anger ‚Üí Increased size ‚Üí Bigger loss ‚Üí Rage ‚Üí Blow up

üìà EVIDENCE:
   ‚Ä¢ Normal trade size: $5,861
   ‚Ä¢ Revenge trade size: 17.1x larger
   ‚Ä¢ Damage from revenge trades: -$138,447
   ‚Ä¢ Revenge trades follow losses: 89% of the time
   ‚Ä¢ Failure rate: 78%

‚ö° HARSH TRUTH:
   Your $59K loss wasn't bad luck. It was inevitable. You're fighting the 
   market like it's personal.

‚úÖ THE FIX:
   After any loss > 2%, mandatory 24hr cooling period. No exceptions.

================================================================================
üéØ Your trading variance is 2808% - pure chaos
   Confidence: 75% | Severity: HIGH

üìä ROOT CAUSE: Trading on impulse without any systematic approach
üí≠ YOUR INNER VOICE: "I'll know it when I see it."
üîÑ THE LOOP: Random entry ‚Üí Random size ‚Üí Random exit ‚Üí Random results

üìà EVIDENCE:
   ‚Ä¢ Position size CV: 2808%
   ‚Ä¢ Hold time CV: 187%
   ‚Ä¢ No consistent pattern detected

‚ö° HARSH TRUTH:
   You're not trading. You're gambling with a Bloomberg terminal. At least 
   casinos have consistent odds.

‚úÖ THE FIX:
   Document EVERY trade: Entry reason, exit plan, position size rule.

‚ö†Ô∏è  CAVEATS:
   ‚Ä¢ High variance might partially indicate learning/adaptation

================================================================================
                            THE BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

You have the skill to find winners (GOONC +$204K, KLED +$132K).
But you're sabotaging yourself with three specific behaviors:

1. DENIAL: Holding losers 27% longer, hoping they'll recover
2. REVENGE: 10x position sizes after losses, trying to "get even"
3. CHAOS: No consistent process, just emotional reactions

This isn't about strategy. It's about psychology.

Right now you're a gambler who got lucky. The data proves it.
When your luck runs out (and it will), these patterns will destroy you.

The market doesn't care about your feelings.
It doesn't owe you anything.
It will take everything if you let it.

Fix your mind or the market will break it.

üö® CRITICAL: Immediate action required to prevent account blow-up!

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM SHALLOW ANALYSIS:

‚ùå Shallow: "Your win rate is low"
‚úÖ Deep: "26% win rate + profitable = you're lucky, not good"

‚ùå Shallow: "Your largest loss was $59K"  
‚úÖ Deep: "$59K was 17x normal size after losses = revenge trading"

‚ùå Shallow: "Hold losers less time"
‚úÖ Deep: "27% longer hold = ego protection loop preventing growth"

This is what traders actually need to hear.
Not comfortable. Not nice. But true.
