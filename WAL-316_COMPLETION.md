# WAL-316: Measure actual RPS - COMPLETED âœ…

## Summary
Added real-time RPS (Requests Per Second) measurement to the blockchain fetcher to monitor actual API throughput.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced RateLimitedFetcher Class
- Added `deque` to track timestamps of last 1000 requests
- Calculate rolling RPS over 5-second sliding window
- Method `calculate_rps()` computes requests/second dynamically

### 2. Progress Reporting Updates
- Individual page fetches now show: `Page X: Y transactions (Actual RPS: Z.Z)`
- Batch completion shows: `Batch X complete: Total Y transactions so far (Actual RPS: Z.Z)`
- Added RPS Statistics section to final summary

### 3. Statistics Tracking
Added to final report:
```
=== RPS STATISTICS ===
Actual RPS: X.X
Total requests: Y
Rate limit hits: Z
Max concurrent: 40
```

## Key Code Changes

### blockchain_fetcher_v3.py
```python
# Added to RateLimitedFetcher.__init__:
self._request_timestamps: deque = deque(maxlen=1000)
self._window_seconds = 5

# New method:
def calculate_rps(self) -> float:
    """Calculate requests per second over the sliding window"""
    # ... implementation ...

# Updated progress messages:
self._report_progress(f"Page {page_num}: {len(data)} transactions (Actual RPS: {actual_rps:.1f})")
```

## Verification
Created test that confirmed:
- RPS calculation works correctly (tested with 10 requests over 2 seconds, got ~5 RPS)
- Progress messages include RPS data
- Final statistics section shows RPS metrics

## Expected Output
```
Page 1: 100 transactions (Actual RPS: 0.0)
Page 2: 100 transactions (Actual RPS: 2.0)
Batch 1 complete: Total 500 transactions so far (Actual RPS: 15.3)
...
=== RPS STATISTICS ===
Actual RPS: 38.5
Total requests: 86
Rate limit hits: 0
Max concurrent: 40
```

## Impact
- Provides real-time visibility into API performance
- Helps diagnose if we're hitting rate limits vs network/processing bottlenecks
- Shows if paid plan (50 RPS) is actually being utilized
- Enables data-driven decisions about parallel_pages parameter

## Next Steps
With RPS measurement in place, we can now:
1. Verify if we're actually achieving 50 RPS with paid plan
2. Tune parallel_pages based on actual RPS achieved
3. Identify if bottleneck is API rate limits or other factors
