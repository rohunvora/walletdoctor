# WAL-310 Performance Test Results

## Test Configuration
- **Wallet**: 3JoVBiQEA2QKsq7TzW5ez5jVRtbbYgTNijoZzp5qgkr2
- **Trade Count**: 5,478 trades
- **Transaction Pages**: 86 pages
- **Feature**: skip_pricing=True
- **Target**: <20 seconds response time

## Results

### ❌ FAILED - 107.25 seconds (5.4x over target)

### Timing Breakdown
```
fetch_transactions: 105.4s (98.4%) ⚠️ BOTTLENECK
extract_trades:       0.1s (0.1%)
fetch_metadata:       1.7s (1.6%)
dust_filter:          0.0s (0.0%)
calculate_pnl:        0.0s (0.0%)
fetch_prices:      SKIPPED (skip_pricing=True) ✅
TOTAL:              107.1s
```

### Root Cause
- **Sequential page fetching**: 86 pages fetched one at a time
- **Rate limiting**: ~1.2 seconds per page due to Helius rate limits
- **No parallelization**: 86 pages × 1.2s = 103.2s just for fetching

### Metrics
- Signatures Fetched: 5,647
- Signatures Parsed: 5,478 (97.0% parse rate)
- Events Swap: 239 (4.4%)
- Fallback Parser: 5,240 (95.6%) ✅ Working as expected
- Skip Pricing: SUCCESS (0 priced trades)

## Solution Required

### Implement Parallel Page Fetching
To meet the <20s target, we need to implement concurrent page fetching:

1. **Concurrent Fetching**: Fetch 15 pages simultaneously (respecting 10 RPS limit)
2. **Expected Performance**:
   - 86 pages ÷ 15 concurrent = 6 batches
   - 6 batches × 1s = ~6s for fetching
   - Total time: ~10-15s (well under 20s target)

### Implementation Notes
- Modify `BlockchainFetcherV3._fetch_swap_transactions()` to use `asyncio.gather()`
- Maintain rate limiting with semaphore (max 10 concurrent requests)
- Collect results in order to maintain pagination continuity

## Current Status
- ✅ Skip pricing working correctly
- ✅ Progress tracking implemented
- ✅ Fallback parser achieving 97% parse rate
- ❌ Performance not meeting target due to sequential fetching

## Next Steps
1. Implement parallel page fetching in BlockchainFetcherV3
2. Re-run performance test
3. Target: <20s for 5k+ trade wallets 

## Updates

### WAL-311 ✅ Complete
- Implemented RateLimitedFetcher with asyncio.Semaphore(10)
- Properly limits concurrent requests to Helius API

### WAL-312 ✅ Complete
- Implemented parallel page fetching infrastructure
- Fetches pages in batches of 15
- Performance still ~110s (no improvement yet)

### WAL-313 ✅ Complete
- Implemented batch-wide 429 handling with exponential backoff
- Retries entire batch with 5s/10s/20s delays
- Prevents cascading rate limit errors
- Test confirmed proper backoff behavior
