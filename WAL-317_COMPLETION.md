# WAL-317: Auto-tune parallel_pages - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Implemented dynamic auto-tuning of `parallel_pages` based on 429 error rate to optimize API throughput.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added Auto-tuning Variables
```python
# In BlockchainFetcherV3.__init__:
self.consecutive_no_429_batches = 0
self.min_parallel_pages = 5
self.max_parallel_pages = 50
self.initial_parallel_pages = parallel_pages
```

### 2. Auto-tuning Logic in _fetch_pages_parallel
- Calculates 429 rate: `rate_429 = pages_with_429 / num_pages`
- If `rate_429 > 0.05` (more than 5% hit 429):
  - Reduces: `parallel_pages *= 0.8` (floor at 5)
  - Resets consecutive success counter
- If `rate_429 == 0` for 3 consecutive batches:
  - Increases: `parallel_pages *= 1.1` (ceiling at 50)
  - Resets counter after increase

### 3. Progress Reporting
- Shows auto-tune decisions in real-time:
  ```
  Auto-tune: High 429 rate (15.00%), reducing parallel_pages from 40 to 32
  Auto-tune: No 429s for 3 batches, increasing parallel_pages from 32 to 35
  ```
- Final report shows tuning results:
  ```
  Final parallel_pages: 35 (started at 40)
  ```

## Behavior

### Scaling Down
- Triggers when >5% of pages in a batch hit 429
- Reduces by 20% (multiply by 0.8)
- Minimum floor of 5 pages
- Immediate response to rate limits

### Scaling Up
- Requires 3 consecutive batches with 0% 429 rate
- Increases by 10% (multiply by 1.1)
- Maximum ceiling of 50 pages
- Conservative growth to avoid triggering limits

## Test Results
```
Testing auto-tuning...
Initial parallel_pages: 10
Auto-tuned up: 10 -> 11
Auto-tuned down: 11 -> 8
✅ PASSED: Auto-tuning works correctly
```

## Expected Impact
- Automatically finds optimal throughput for each API key
- Adapts to rate limit changes without manual intervention
- Maximizes performance while minimizing 429 errors
- Works with both free (10 RPS) and paid (50 RPS) plans
